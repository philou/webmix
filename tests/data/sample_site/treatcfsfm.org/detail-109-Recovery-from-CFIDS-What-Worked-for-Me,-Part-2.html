			  <p><i>(Note: Second of two articles. Read part 1&nbsp;</i><a href="detail-108-Recovery-from-CFIDS-What-Worked-for-Me,-Part-1.html"><i>here</i></a><i>. The two parts are an expanded version of an article published in the CFIDS Chronicle as a two-part series in Spring and Summer 2002.) </i><br />
<br />
When I became ill with CFIDS in 1997, I functioned at about 25% of my  pre-illness level. Five years later, I consider myself recovered. <br />
<br />
I no  longer experience symptoms of CFIDS and have an activity level  comparable to that of other people of my age. I have even been able to  return to hiking. On a recent trip to Yosemite, I hiked almost 90 miles  in six days, at a speed comparable to my pace when I was 10 to 15 years  younger.</p>
<p><br />
My improvement has been gradual but steady, averaging one or two percent  a month. I followed exclusively a self-help approach in my efforts to  improve. In the first part of this article I described four elements of  my self-management program. I discuss three more in this part.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>1) Having Faith <br />
</b></span></span><br />
I believe that faith was an important part of my improvement. By that I  am not referring to something religious, but rather to a belief that my  body had an innate drive to reestablish good health.<br />
<br />
I thought I had two  roles in support of my body: 1) to discover what conditions best  supported my body's recuperative powers, and 2) to live consistently in a  way that allowed these powers to be expressed. <br />
<br />
I call this faith  because I had to proceed with little or no reinforcement that I was  doing the right thing. My progress was very slow and there were periods  of several months when it was hard to see any improvement.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>Pacing <br />
</b></span></span><br />
I came to believe that creating stability was one of the most helpful  things I could do for my body. This idea developed in response to the  frustration I experienced in my first several months with CFIDS, when my  life was on a roller coaster. <br />
<br />
I rested when my symptoms were intense,  then was overactive when the symptoms declined. Doing too much led to  high symptoms again and the demoralizing cycle started over. I was  living in response to my symptoms, which left me feeling my life was out  of control.</p>
<p><br />
The idea of pacing offered an alternative. Pacing meant finding the  right balance of activity and rest, and applying that balance on an  everyday basis. <br />
<br />
The key was to live a life that was planned, with a  similar amount of activity and rest every day. Having a consistent level  of activity made sense, but I resisted the idea of scheduling rest  every day. <br />
<br />
It was hard to accept the idea that I would lie down  voluntarily regardless of how I felt. I decided to try it by having a  fifteen minute rest every afternoon. Much to my surprise, the rest  helped, reducing my symptoms and making my life more stable. After a  while I added a morning rest as well. I also experimented with how I  structured my rests, finally defining rest as &quot;lying down in a quiet  place with my eyes closed.&quot;</p>
<p><br />
I found that taking these &quot;pre-emptive rests,&quot; as a friend called them,  enabled me to reduce the time I spent in &quot;recuperative rest&quot; or resting  in response to symptoms. The result was that my total rest time was  reduced. Looking back, I think the two daily rests were the most  important thing I did to aid my recovery. <br />
<br />
Resting on a planned schedule  greatly stabilized my life, enabling me to get off the roller coaster  and giving me a much greater sense of control. Seeing that there was  something I could do that gave me some control boosted my confidence  that I could bring the illness as a whole under control.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>Building on the Positive<br />
</b></span></span><br />
My daily record keeping ended with an overall rating for the day. My  scale went from +2 if it was a very good day to -2 for a very bad one.  It gave me hope to see that not all days were the same, that some were  better than others. <br />
<br />
Having good days also was very motivating. I asked  myself: what am I doing differently on those days and how can I do more  of it? This was another way in which I reinforced for myself a belief  that I could gain control over the illness. It also deepened my  conviction that I could find things that improved my quality of life.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>Controlling Stress<br />
</b></span></span><br />
Early on I discovered that CFIDS made me very stress-sensitive. Any kind  of conflict set off my symptoms and often things as simple as making  decisions felt overwhelming. Even modest amounts of stress greatly  intensified my symptoms, creating a feedback loop in which my symptoms  and my response to them intensified one another. <br />
<br />
Once I realized how  vulnerable to stress I had become, I decided that dealing with stress  sensitivity had to be a big part of my effort to manage CFIDS.</p>
<p><br />
My first reaction was to try various strategies for stress reduction.  The most helpful proved to be a regular relaxation/meditation practice,  which I included in my daily rests. Relaxing my mind while relaxing my  body had a dramatic effect on my anxiety level, thus reducing my  tendency to over-produce adrenalin.</p>
<p><br />
Stress avoidance proved to be even more helpful. I learned that I could  prevent stress by avoiding those things that caused it. The most useful  strategy in that regard was routine: living my life as much as I could  according to a plan. <br />
<br />
Having a daily schedule of activity, rest, exercise  and socializing at set times gave structure and predictability to my  life. With routine I had less pressure, and fewer surprises and  emotional shocks.</p>
<p><br />
I also learned to identify stress triggers, those situations and even  specific people that set off symptoms. I learned, for example, that I  was vulnerable to sensory overload after observing how noisy situations  quickly led to intense symptoms. I also observed that situations of  conflict were much more stressful than before. I then tried to avoid or  minimize these stress triggers.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>Managing Emotions<br />
</b></span></span><br />
I knew from my work at Stanford that strong emotions are normal  reactions to having a chronic illness. Serious illness turns people's  lives upside down, upsetting their hopes and goals, and creating  frustration and uncertainty. So I knew intellectually that managing  emotions could be just as challenging as managing the physical aspects  of the illness. <br />
<br />
I don't think this background prepared me, however, for  the strength of the feelings associated with CFIDS and their apparent  connection with the physiology of the illness. I felt less in control of  my emotions than at almost any time in my life.</p>
<p><br />
I developed a number of strategies in response, all based on recognition  that I was much more emotionally vulnerable than usual. First, I  observed that the strength of my emotions was often associated with the  strength of my physical symptoms, and that the strategies used to  control symptoms also helped moderate my emotions. In particular,  resting seemed to reduce the intensity of emotions as well as  alleviating my fatigue and brain fog.</p>
<p><br />
Second, I observed that I had an exaggerated initial reaction to  relapses, often seeing them as evidence I would never improve. So I  learned to talk in reassuring tones to myself. I consoled myself by  saying things like &quot;you've always bounced back from other setbacks&quot; or  &quot;remember how life looks better after you've rested.&quot;</p>
<p><br />
Third, I trained myself to mute my emotions after observing the toll  that strong emotions took on me, whether positive or negative. It seemed  that experiences that triggered the release of adrenalin led to an  increase in symptoms. As a way to avoid symptoms, I tried to cultivate  calmness and to construct a life that emphasized routine.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>2) Creating New Meaning in Response to Loss <br />
</b></span></span><br />
My work at Stanford had convinced me that chronic illness was inherently  depressing. What other reaction would you expect if a normal life was  replaced with one that involved large amounts of suffering and great  uncertainty about the future? <br />
<br />
But an even bigger challenge was coming to  terms with loss. Having CFIDS stripped away most of what I viewed as  myself. Because of CFIDS, I gave up work and volunteer commitments, let  most relationships slide, lost my ability to be physically active, and  replaced an optimistic view of my future with uncertainty.</p>
<p><br />
I did two things to cope with loss. The first was to publicly  acknowledge the loss. In a Christmas letter sent a year and a half after  getting CFIDS, I wrote to friends that I had been living with a disease  for which there was no standard treatment or cure. <br />
<br />
And I concluded: &quot;I  am sobered by the realization that it is highly unlikely that I will  return to the level of functioning that I had before becoming ill and so  probably will have to adjust to living a life with greater limits than  before.&quot; <br />
<br />
Even though I wrote to alert others to expect less of me in the  future, I think the more profound effects were on me. Even though my  prediction turned out to be wrong, the public declaration helped me  recognize the extent of my loss and the possibility that it was  permanent.</p>
<p><br />
My other response to loss was to create new relationships and new  meaning in my life. Within weeks of receiving my diagnosis, I joined two  local support groups. <br />
<br />
The experience was especially useful for the  friends I made. I found there is something powerfully healing about  feeling understood, all the more so for a stigmatized disease that some  don't believe is real. <br />
<br />
Illness is isolating; feeling connected to others  gave me a sense of belonging. Also, fellow patients were tremendous  sources of information and perspective, helping me to understand CFIDS  much more quickly than I could have on my own.</p>
<p><br />
Because I stopped working and dropped out of my volunteer commitments  shortly after becoming ill, fellow patients became perhaps my most  important community. I think that served me well. I took CFIDS patients  to be my peers, not healthy people. That meant that I measured myself in  comparison to them, not to my peers from work or healthy friends. That  comparison took a lot of pressure off.</p>
<p><br />
A few months after receiving my diagnosis, I started a self-help class  for myself and other patients I had met. Over time it has become the  CFIDS/Fibromyalgia Self-Help program. <br />
<br />
Developing the program enabled me  to find new meaning in response to the losses I had experienced due to  the illness. By developing new goals and focusing on what I was still  able to do, I found a way to feel useful even when previous roles had  fallen away.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>3) Living a Disciplined Life<br />
</b></span></span><br />
The final factor in my recovery strategy was discipline. By this I mean  learning to live consistently within my energy envelope and extending my  activity level gradually as permitted by the illness. <br />
<br />
Just as an  alcoholic must learn to abstain from alcohol and a person controlling  his weight must learn to live in a different way, I assumed that my  ability to improve depended on my changing my habits so that I lived  consistently in a way conducive to recovery.</p>
<p><br />

<p style="margin-left: 40px"><i>[The] Self-Help Course provides the  information and the structure needed to facilitate changing one's habits  and routines---something that is hard for all of us. Not a prescription  for what to do, the course is a process of discovering for ourselves  what we uniquely need to change in our lifestyle. <br />
<br />
Just as Weight  Watchers and Alcoholics Anonymous provide the information and structure  people need to change their eating and drinking habits, this course  provides what PWCs [people with CFIDS] need to change our daily routines  and find a way of living that helps to reduce symptoms and that, in  some cases, has led to significant recovery.</i></p>

Dean Anderson says much the same thing in the account of his  recovery, also published in the CFIDS Chronicle. He believes that the  key to his recovery was a certain kind of acceptance, different from  resignation. It was &quot;acceptance of the reality of illness and of the  need to lead a different kind of life, perhaps for the rest of my life.&quot;  <br />
<br />
He went on to say that &quot;the &lsquo;effort' required to recover from CFIDS is  an exercise in discipline and hopefulness.&quot; The discipline he believes  is needed is the opposite of the discipline of striving. It is the  discipline &quot;to recognize and adhere to one's known limitations and to  follow a strict regimen without periodically lapsing.&quot;</p>
<p><br />
For me, learning to live consistently within my Energy Envelope required  that I first find my limits, as described in section 3, and then honor  them. I developed a number of strategies to help me stay inside my  envelope and to handle &quot;lapses.&quot; <br />
<br />
Perhaps the most useful was to  visualize how I would feel if I went outside my envelope. Imagining the  fatigue and brain fog provided a counterweight to the immediate pleasure  I anticipate from doing something that took me beyond my limit.</p>
<p><br />
Record-keeping also helped me live within my limits. Having written  proof of the effects of my actions helped me to hold myself accountable  for my actions. Records were a graphic and irrefutable way to prove to  myself what doing too much did to me in terms of symptoms and the need  for extra rest. Also, I used my health log as a positive motivator,  helping me aim for more frequent no-symptom days.</p>
<p><br />
A third strategy was the use of routine. Having a regular schedule  enabled me to avoid a lot of decision making. Instead of having to ask  whether something was or was not within my envelope, I tried to stick to  a schedule I knew was safe. <br />
<br />
A related idea is what I call having rules  for specific situations. For example, during one period I found I could  drive without intensifying symptoms if I took a 10-minute break every  two hours.</p>
<p><br />
Finally, I tried to be forgiving with myself. I didn't always stay in my  envelope. But, instead of beating myself up for failing, I decided it  was better to just to say &quot;what can I learn from this experience&quot; and  move on.</p>
<p><br />
This approach required a great deal of patience. As noted in the section  on faith, I needed to feel confident that my approach would pay off in  the long run. Although it was very difficult at times, I resisted the  temptation to hope for a quick recovery and I took consolation in my  steady progress, even if it was at a pace of one or two percent a month.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>Summary<br />
</b></span></span><br />
I began my journey of self-healing with an acceptance that my life had  changed, perhaps forever and certainly for an extended period. I  believed that to get better I would have to accept responsibility for  finding things that would help me. <br />
<br />
I acknowledged that CFIDS imposed  severe limits, and decided that living a disciplined life consistent  with those limits offered the best chance of controlling symptoms and  improving my quality of life. Finally, I had confidence that I could  find things that would help me get better and committed myself to  experimenting to find what worked.</p>
<p><br />
My approach of using self-help exclusively was different from that taken  by most patients. Under different circumstances, I might have combined a  self-management approach with a medical one. <br />
<br />
But self-help served me  well, enabling me to regain my health gradually over a period of four  years, using techniques I believed were safe and prudent, focusing as  they did on living within limits and extending those limits very  gradually as allowed by the illness.</p>
<p><br />
Your illness may be more or less severe than mine. Your life  circumstances are likely to be different in one or more ways. You may  decide that medications and other treatments can be helpful to you. But I  hope you will also explore what you can do to help yourself.</p>			  </td>
