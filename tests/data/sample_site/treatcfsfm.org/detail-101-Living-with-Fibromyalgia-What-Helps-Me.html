			  <p><i>Editor's Note: Kathy Gamble, a fibromyalgia patient from Florida,  was a long-time moderator and the second Executive Director of the CFIDS  and Fibromyalgia Self-Help Program. </i><br />
<br />
When I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 1999, it felt like the last  straw in my world coming apart. <br />
<br />
My divorce had been final the month  before, and the year had already been filled with other emotional  traumas. While I was grateful that the diagnosis explained the aches and  the fatigue I had experienced for several months, having a chronic  illness felt like one more loss.</p>
<p><br />
My doctor reviewed with me a short list of options for treatment of  fibromyalgia that included medications as well as other treatments such  as heat, massage and stretching. He also advised staying as active as  possible and suggested something I found amusing: &quot;Eliminate unnecessary  stress in your life.&quot;</p>
<p><br />
I was taking only over-the-counter pain medications and did not want to  start more medications yet. I preferred to see how I could manage on my  own first. I was still working full-time as a nurse and I rarely missed  work due to my symptoms. Most days I did okay, so I thought I would just  continue on as I always had. I functioned at 75 on the <a href="http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/cfs-fibromyalgia-rating-scale" target="_blank">CFS &amp; Fibromyalgia Rating Scale</a>.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>Looking for Answers<br />
</b></span></span><br />
However, in my second year with fibromyalgia, my health declined. I  would come home from work and collapse in bed, unable and unwilling to  move. Each morning brought another struggle to get out of bed, and I  would drag through work. <br />
<br />
This daily grind of dragging myself out of bed,  struggling through the day and then collapsing when I got home did not  seem to be much of a life. I was too exhausted to do anything else that  had been helpful to me before - all I wanted to do was rest!</p>
<p><br />
But I knew I couldn't keep on like this, so I started to look for more  answers. The thought that there might be other ways to manage this  condition motivated me to look for more information on fibromyalgia.  Usually if one is ready to learn, the teachers appear and I found this  to be true for me in this case.</p>
<p><br />
One teacher was a book by Stacie L. Bigelow titled Fibromyalgia: Simple  Relief Through Movement. The author compared the muscles of a person  with fibromyalgia to wet concrete. She stated that if muscles aren't  moved frequently, they can stiffen and set, just like real concrete  does. She explained how movement can assist with feeling better from the  pain of fibromyalgia.</p>
<p><br />
I found this book to be extraordinarily helpful. It distinguished  between &quot;movement&quot; and &quot;activity&quot; on the one hand and &quot;exercise&quot;. I  learned that I would feel worse if I stayed in one position for too  long. <br />
<br />
I began to pay attention to how long I was sitting in a meeting,  working at a computer, or even lying down and resting. I found that a  change in position, moving around, or walking briefly, meant less  soreness and stiffness.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>Self-Help and Guaifenesin<br />
</b></span></span><br />
Shortly after reading the book, I started exploring the About.com  section on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and fibromyalgia. This is where I  found out about the CFIDS Self-Help course, now called the CFIDS &amp;  Fibromyalgia Self-Help course. The course was described as a &quot;blending  of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with group support and principles of  self-management&quot;. <br />
<br />
The description was appealing to me, because it seemed  consistent with what I was gradually learning: that I was the best  manager of my condition and could learn what was helpful and what was  harmful to me. I signed up.</p>
<p><br />
I found in the class that there were other people like me across the US  and in other countries. Plus, there seemed to be hope, as specific  behaviors were identified that could help to manage the symptoms. The  course textbook alone would have been a benefit, but to have a group  that worked through the chapters together was even better.</p>
<p><br />
I also continued to explore the CFS/FMS section of About.com. It was  here that I first read about the guaifenesin protocol, and people who  claimed wonderful responses to this treatment. I checked out a linked  website:&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fibromyalgiatreatment.com">www.fibromyalgiatreatment.com</a>&nbsp;. I was intrigued, so I ordered the source book, <i>What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Fibromyalgia</i>, by Dr. Paul St. Amand.</p>
<p><br />
I started the guaifenesin protocol on my own, as I am a nurse and since I  had taken guaifenesin previously for coughs. After only a few days, I  noticed that I had some energy again. My energy kept improving for the  first month or so, and I didn't seem to have any of the expected  worsening symptoms. <br />
<br />
But then I experienced the first of several  &quot;reversal cycles,&quot; in which my symptoms worsened and I felt as bad as  before starting the treatment. But these have faded over time and I  credit guaifenesin with helping to improve my quality of life.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>What Works for Me<br />
</b></span></span><br />
In the initial years after my fibromyalgia diagnosis, I encountered  various treatments, activities, and learning experiences. I really  wanted something to &quot;cure&quot; my fibromyalgia. I wanted to get rid of this  condition, like taking an antibiotic for an infection.</p>
<p><br />
I know now there is no single panacea for treating this condition. But I  have discovered ways of being and coping that have worked for me in  managing my health with fibromyalgia. Here is what I have learned so  far, what I have found helps me:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Resting </b>- I rest when I need it, and also when I think I  don't need it. When I listen to my body, it tells me when I need to  rest. I do much better when I listen and respond appropriately than when  I ignore what I am trying to tell myself. I had to learn to rest, as I  was used to using my time &quot;productively.&quot; <br />
    <br />
    I had to learn to stop and  rest, and use the self-help course's definition of rest: lying down with  eyes closed in a quiet environment. Being on the phone or watching TV  while lying down did not qualify as rest. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Sleeping well at night </b>- My outlook on life improves  dramatically when I have had a good night's sleep. In contrast, if I am  awake all night or even part of the night, the next day is difficult. <br />
    <br />
    To  help me sleep better, I had to quit staying up late, eliminate  stressful evening activities (like being on the phone), and identify  what could help me get a good night's sleep. This includes going to bed  by 10 p.m., taking 20 to 30 minutes for reading or prayer, and using  medications, as described in the next section. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Taking medication as needed </b>- Besides the daily  Guaifenesin, I take Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or Acetominophen (Bylenol)  during the day for headaches or pain as needed. I also have two  prescription medications, including a muscle relaxant that I take at  night, which helps me to go to sleep and stay asleep. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Using low heat </b>- Either a heating pad or an electric  blanket, depending on how much and where I ache. If I turn the heat up  past low, I start to feel worse. A warm bath also helps! <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Avoiding certain foods </b>- I read the Sugarbusters book,  The Zone, and the dietary guidelines in the book on guaifenesin. While I  don't adhere to all their principles, I do feel better when I keep to  the guidelines than when I don't, particularly in avoiding foods with  white sugar. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Moving/activity </b>- I feel better if I take &quot;walk breaks&quot;  at work or have some sort of change in position if I have been sitting  for more than 30 minutes. As mentioned earlier, I learned this from  reading Stacie Bigelow's book. Mild stretching in the mornings or in the  evenings also helps to decrease some of the aches and soreness,  particularly in my lower back. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Being aware of how I feel </b>- Denying my pain and not  paying attention to myself and how I feel can lead to my feeling worse,  so I have learned to adjust and do what helps me. At the same time, it  doesn't help me to ruminate on how bad I feel, because then I feel worse  and notice the pain more. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Limiting social activities and having a quiet home life </b>-  Being around a lot of people can be draining and I am in that situation  every day at work. So when I get home, I usually just keep to myself.  It helps me to be at home in quiet surroundings and to be peaceful. I  can catch up with others as needed on Facebook or through email. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Planning for work </b>- It helps me to have some control over  my work hours. Having to be at work very early or staying late is hard  on me but manageable one or two times a week, as long as I plan for how I  will make up for it on other days. Also, I have learned that I am more  effective if I set a limited number of priorities for each day.  Otherwise, the details can overwhelm me. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Reframing </b>- I don't have control over what happens in my  day, but I am working on determining how I will react to what happens.  Sometimes that means choosing not to react or not to respond. For  example, I get a lot of emails at work that contain new assignments or  requests for information. Some are rather demanding. <br />
    <br />
    If I responded immediately to every one of them, I would spend time  and energy on things that may be better handled another way. Now I  choose whether to respond immediately or answer later when I have had an  opportunity to think it through or talk with others first. <br />
    <br />
    Sometimes I choose not to answer at all, and that has helped me on  several occasions. I have either followed up with a phone or a  conversation in person to explain. These strategies have often kept me  from reacting negatively to uninvited demands. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Scheduling in recovery time </b>- By scheduling planned time  to rest, I can help defray some of the excesses as they come up. For  example, if I have to stay late at work one day, then I may leave early  the following day. <br />
    <br />
    Likewise, when I have company during holidays, I set  aside days before or after when I can have time by myself to rest. By  planning for and scheduling my needed recovery time in advance, I am  more likely to stick to it. This strategy helps me decrease additional  pain or flares from overdoing. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Seeking help from outside sources </b>- When life became too  much for me, I sought help from outside sources. I have participated in  some online and in-person 12 step groups, and I have had a wonderful  counselor. Both were extraordinarily positive experiences. <br />
    <br />
    Also,  allowing and requesting help from others has been helpful. Sometimes  this has resulted in positive development for others, as well as  decreasing my burden tremendously. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Praying/meditation </b>- I have found that particularly in  times of increased symptoms, simply to be quiet and reflect or pray can  have a very calming effect. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Scheduling massages </b>- It may be painful at the time, but I usually feel better afterwards. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Utilizing aromatherapy </b>- Particularly lavender and some of the citrus scents, either in candles that I burn or in lotions. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Taking the self-help follow-up courses and participating in the alumni group </b>-  I participate in two groups that were offered to graduates of the  introductory CFIDS &amp; Fibromyalgia Self-Help class: followup courses  and an alumni group. The followup courses focus on helping people reach  short-term goals. Despite knowing what I need to do to manage  fibromyalgia, putting it into practice is not always easy. <br />
    <br />
    The followup courses have been one of the best opportunities for  putting knowledge into practice through making weekly targets. Even when  I don't meet my targets, I learn more about myself and what I can do to  manage this condition. <br />
    <br />
    The alumni group provides an opportunity for ongoing support plus  discussion of topics related to living with chronic illness. We all  continue to learn from each other through our responses. We also can  keep up with one another through the monthly &quot;check-ins&quot; with our  responses. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Making a NOT TO DO list </b>- I pickup up this wonderful idea  for me from one of the other articles on this site! It helped to know  what things I consciously wanted to avoid.&nbsp; <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>Conclusion<br />
</b></span></span><br />
Over all, my quality of life has improved dramatically using the  strategies I've described. I rate myself currently at 90 on the CFS  &amp; Fibromyalgia Rating Scale. I am not back to &quot;normal,&quot; but I've  learned that that is OK. I don't want to be as driven as I was before  getting fibromyalgia. <br />
<br />
I have a clearer understanding now of my boundaries and I do well as  long as I stay inside them. It took some time, but I finally learned  that I have to respect and honor my body, and listen to the messages it  gives me. The messages are to slow down, to learn to &quot;be&quot; and not just  &quot;do,&quot; and to focus on what is really important.</p>			  </td>
