			  <p><i>Note: Joan Buchman is a fibromyalgia patient from California. She  is a long-time moderator in the CFIDS &amp; Fibromyalgia Self-Help  Program.</i></p>
<p><br />
I struggled with fibromyalgia for eight years before achieving  stability. Little did I suspect in my eighth year with FMS that a crisis  was coming that would upset that stability or that help would come from  a simple daily exercise.</p>
<p><br />
<b><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia">Adapting to Fibromyalgia<br />
</span></span></b><br />
My fibromyalgia began when I developed muscle pain in my upper body.  Then I started having problems with my sleep, waking up several times  during the night and feeling totally exhausted in the morning.</p>
<p><br />
After months of visits to a number of doctors, I was finally diagnosed  with FMS. I was relieved to find a name to go with my symptoms, but  after that initial euphoria, was left with the task of learning how to  live with this debilitating and chronic illness.</p>
<p><br />
I spent the next few years experiencing the stages of grieving and over  time came a long way toward acceptance of my condition, creating a life  within the limits of this illness. My regimen included reading all I  could about my illness, resting, and learning what kinds of exercise I  could do without exacerbating my condition.</p>
<p><br />
I also joined a local FMS support group, became good friends with other  FMS patients and re-evaluated which activities and relationships were  causing me stress, making some changes. <br />
<br />
I gradually improved to where  most days, physically, I was between 40% and 60% of my functioning  before FMS. Physically, mentally and emotionally, I had crafted a life  that worked for me and my illness; I was feeling the best I had in many  years.</p>
<p><br />
<b><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia">Family Crisis Upsets a Delicate Balance<br />
</span></span></b><br />
Then a family crisis arose that upset the delicate balance I had so  carefully created. Suddenly, a previously slow-growing thyroid cancer  that my husband's sister, Janette, had been living with for over 20  years, became active and very fast moving. After unsuccessful  chemotherapy, the cancer had spread to her liver and she was going  downhill quickly.</p>
<p><br />
My husband and I asked her to come live with us, which she accepted. For  the next 5-1/2 months, until her death, we lived together, sharing the  ups and downs, the laughter and tears, the hope and the fear.</p>
<p><br />
As Janette's primary caregiver, I was unable to continue with my daily  routine of exercise, regular resting and social activities. The high  stress and the loss of my routine led to some increase in pain and  fatigue. <br />
<br />
The stress of caregiving for those months affected me  emotionally more than anything. Seeing someone I loved fading before my  eyes was very difficult. During this crisis, the emotional support I  needed came from an unexpected source.</p>
<p><br />
<b><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia">Help from a Simple Exercise<br />
</span></span></b><br />
A few months before Janette came to live with us, I was browsing in a  local bookstore while doing Christmas shopping. I spotted a book titled  &quot;The Simple Abundance Journal of Gratitude.&quot; I recognized Sarah Ban  Breathnach as the author of &quot;Simple Abundance.&quot; Most of the book  consisted of a page for each day of the year, followed by five blank  lines.</p>
<p><br />
I was intrigued by her idea that there could be powerful effects from  writing each day five things you were grateful for. I bought the book as  a gift to myself, little knowing what a significant role that small  book would play in helping me survive one of the most stressful periods  of my life.</p>
<p><br />
For a month and a half before Janette came, I wrote in my Gratitude  Journal every day. It was the last thing I did at night before going to  sleep. Sometimes I struggled to find 5 things for which I was grateful;  occasionally, one of those was, &quot;I'm grateful this day has ended.&quot; But I  stuck with it.</p>
<p><br />
During the months Janette was with us, I felt it was very important to  keep up with the Gratitude Journal and I focused on aspects of this  situation from which I could pull out something to be thankful for.  Often, it was something Janette was doing to find peace with her life  and death. She reached out to just about everyone who had ever been in  her life.</p>
<p><br />
In return, she experienced an outpouring of love like I had never seen.  She received many letters, phone calls, even visits from old friends who  traveled cross-country to see her. At times, this outpouring was  overwhelming to her. <br />
<br />
But, at the same time, she was so nurtured by it,  it helped give her strength to go on. Janette was a constant  inspiration, for in her final months, besides reaching out to others,  she took time to appreciate her surroundings and the pleasures of  everyday life.</p>
<p><br />
We took her to the California Coast one weekend and she was inspired by  the nature that was there. She stared at the ocean and the contentment  on her face was amazing. Paul took her to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and  she loved it. She was reaching out to grasp everything around her, even  though she knew she didn't have long to live.</p>
<p><br />
<b><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia">Learning the Power of Gratitude<br />
</span></span></b><br />
Janette taught me to treasure what I have right now. Gratitude means  appreciating what you have and making the most from that. So I began to  express in my journal appreciation for people in my life and my life as  it was. That led to feelings of gratitude for the lessons I had been  learning about myself because of my illness. <br />
<br />
I had learned that moving  as fast as I could, doing as much as possible, was not making me happy. I  was not taking any time to nurture my physical, mental or emotional  needs. I believe that my body was shouting at me to slow down and savor  life.</p>
<p><br />
I think I would have learned about gratitude on my own by writing the  Gratitude Journal for that entire year. But Janette, as a shining  example of experiencing gratitude during a crisis, gave me a crash  course in finding gratitude in my life. <br />
<br />
From Janette's model of living  her last days with grace and appreciation of everything she had right  then, I learned that I can live a happy and peaceful life with my  chronic illness.</p>
<p><br />
In fact, I would even say I am grateful for FMS, for without it, I would  not have been forced to take a close look at how I was living. My life  today is not the life I had imagined, but, looking back, I realize that I  was not on a track for happiness and peace. Because of FMS, I have had  the opportunity to find out what is really important for me to live a  fulfilling and meaningful life.</p>
<p><br />
Gratitude is not about &quot;looking at the bright side&quot; or denying the  realities of life. Gratitude goes much deeper than that. It's about  learning from a situation, taking the good to help deal with other  challenges in the future. <br />
<br />
It's about finding out that you have more  power over your life than you previously imagined. You can stop being a  victim of your circumstances and reach out to the joy in living. If you  open your heart to the good in your life, gratitude becomes as much a  part of your life as breathing.</p>
<p><br />
So I continue to write in my Gratitude Journal. Only now, I do it in my  head, every minute of every day. I do not limit myself to five lines.</p>
<p><br />
The gift I gave myself that Christmas of the Gratitude Journal changed  my life. After struggling with FMS for years, searching for answers and  cures, I was finally able to reach a level of acceptance that has  dramatically improved my quality of life. <br />
<br />
I am better at pacing my  activities, listening to my body and have more patience with myself and  others. I have found joy at every turn, from appreciating the beauty of  nature to improved relationships with family and friends.</p>
<p><br />
I still have muscle pain and fatigue. Those symptom levels remain fairly  constant. But that journal opened the door to unconditional happiness  with the hand I was dealt. I can look beyond the pain and fatigue and  look forward to each day and the joy it will bring. And it all started  with a book I saw at a bookstore amid the hustle and bustle of Christmas  shopping.</p>
