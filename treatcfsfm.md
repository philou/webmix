# How I Improved My Life by Accepting My Limits | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Bianca Veness, a CFS patient from Australia, is a moderator in the CFIDS & Fibromyalgia Self-Help program. This article is adapted from a message sent to a class she taught. *
I spent many years fighting my illness and the limits it imposed on me, and experienced frequent crashes as a result. Eventually I recognized the futility of my approach and adopted a new attitude to my CFS.
Rather than fighting my illness, I accepted it and, over time, have created a new way of life in tune with my body. By learning from the illness, I've moved from a roller coaster life to a life with more peace and stability, and a lower level of symptoms.
**Fighting My Limits**
I was diagnosed with CFS when I became bedbound with the illness. After spending a year at home recuperating, I went on to finish high school then moved away from home to go to college.
During this time I often didn't tell people I was sick, and when I did they had trouble believing it, because I worked harder than anyone else. I held myself to impossibly high standards, wanting to prove the illness couldn't stop me from leading a normal life.
I fought my limits all the time. I would crash, be forced to spend weeks or months recovering, then do it all over again. I experienced peaks and troughs in my health, but the general trend of my health was downward. Eventually I didn't feel I could manage any more and I dropped out of school.
Leaving school helped me to realize that I was living the wrong kind of life. I was trying to force myself beyond my limits, always pushing the envelope, battling against my illness. It was painful. I had high symptoms, frequent severe crashes and was constantly in a state of stress, anxiety and emotional turmoil. I blamed the illness for doing this to me.
**Illness as Teacher**
Gradually I came to realize that the illness was not responsible for my stressful life; I was. I was not acknowledging that my body had changed and had different needs now.
Rather than seeing the illness as an enemy, I began to see it as a teacher, one that was trying to teach me a valuable lesson - to slow down! Instead of trying to fight the illness, I accepted it. I gave up the idea of returning to my pre-illness life, and began to develop a new way of living.
This might sound like I was giving up hope, but actually it was an incredibly hope-creating experience. I finally acknowledged that I was unwell, that I would have to live a different kind of life, maybe for the rest of my life. And that was okay. Rather than seeing the illness as a prison, and the need to stay within my energy envelope as a trap, I began to see my situation in terms of freedom.
I was freeing myself from a life of unpredictability, from feeling constantly overwhelmed and exhausted. By changing the way I saw my illness and my life, I freed myself from having to live up to the impossible expectations I had for myself. It was a wonderful feeling. Now, I could just be.
I began to really listen to my body and to look after myself, using many of the skills we learn in the CFIDS & FM self-help class like pacing, resting, relaxation and planning. I began to meditate, developed new, less tiring interests, and worked on becoming a more centered person.
And what I became was happy! Not all the time, obviously, but I'm a much happier person now. A lot of my secondary symptoms have evaporated, and I can manage the other ones reasonably well. Because I work with my body rather than against it, I'm not crashing all the time, which means I can do a lot more than others in my state of health.
Someone in one of my classes made a really good point when she said, "I've got to strike a balance somehow, and live a lifestyle that I can manage even when I'm feeling the worst." Finding that point of balance was really important for me. I don't live a perfect life now; I still overdo it sometimes. But I am not always overdoing it, always pushing my limits and then reaching crisis point.
I'm in a place where if I overdo it once, I can recover. I haven't had a major crash in over two years, only a few minor flares, even though I've had my share of troubles during that time (including three moves and nursing a sick family member back to health after a car accident).
CFS has been a wise teacher, giving me the same lesson again and again until I learned it. It has taught me to acknowledge my body's needs, and to spend my energy wisely, doing things I enjoy. It has taught me to be organized and to put thought into what I do. It has taught me to value the important things in life, and to let go of the little things. It has taught me to accept myself as I am.
Some of these lessons have been very painful, and some I am still learning, but the process has been worthwhile. It has enabled me to grow as a person in ways I wouldn't have otherwise.
I've learned patience, discipline and serenity, and all the time spent on my own has given me a chance to become a more spiritual person. CFS paradoxically has been a healing experience for me, as my journey through the illness has led me toward wholeness as a person.
**From Hare to Tortoise**
My experience with CFS reminds me of the story of the hare and the tortoise. Like me in my early years with the illness, the hare goes full tilt towards the finish line, collapses exhausted half-way through and never gets to finish the race! The tortoise, on the other hand, knows how much he can handle. He goes slow and steady and never exceeds his limits, but gets there in the end.
Over time, I've realized that for me 'giving all I have' is not about giving all I have towards doing some task that I feel I 'must' do. It's about giving myself up to the path on which I've been placed (by a higher power, by life or just by circumstance) and accepting it. Allowing myself to be ill, and moving forward, like a tortoise, working with the illness to create a better kind of life.
I deeply respect everyone with CFS/FM. It is a hard illness to manage. I am filled with awe and admiration for my fellow patients, who struggle along against sometimes incredible odds. I see a lot of courage, fortitude and patience.
The value of a tortoise is not about success, money, being the best. The value of a tortoise is in accepting who you are and where you're at; in taking life slowly, and enjoying it along the way. Living the best life you can with what you've been given, which is more courageous and more heroic than anything else I can think of. |

# Living with Fibromyalgia: What Helps Me | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Editor's Note: Kathy Gamble, a fibromyalgia patient from Florida, was a long-time moderator and the second Executive Director of the CFIDS and Fibromyalgia Self-Help Program. *
When I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 1999, it felt like the last straw in my world coming apart.
My divorce had been final the month before, and the year had already been filled with other emotional traumas. While I was grateful that the diagnosis explained the aches and the fatigue I had experienced for several months, having a chronic illness felt like one more loss.
My doctor reviewed with me a short list of options for treatment of fibromyalgia that included medications as well as other treatments such as heat, massage and stretching. He also advised staying as active as possible and suggested something I found amusing: "Eliminate unnecessary stress in your life."
I was taking only over-the-counter pain medications and did not want to start more medications yet. I preferred to see how I could manage on my own first. I was still working full-time as a nurse and I rarely missed work due to my symptoms. Most days I did okay, so I thought I would just continue on as I always had. I functioned at 75 on the [CFS & Fibromyalgia Rating Scale](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/cfs-fibromyalgia-rating-scale).
**Looking for Answers**
However, in my second year with fibromyalgia, my health declined. I would come home from work and collapse in bed, unable and unwilling to move. Each morning brought another struggle to get out of bed, and I would drag through work.
This daily grind of dragging myself out of bed, struggling through the day and then collapsing when I got home did not seem to be much of a life. I was too exhausted to do anything else that had been helpful to me before - all I wanted to do was rest!
But I knew I couldn't keep on like this, so I started to look for more answers. The thought that there might be other ways to manage this condition motivated me to look for more information on fibromyalgia. Usually if one is ready to learn, the teachers appear and I found this to be true for me in this case.
One teacher was a book by Stacie L. Bigelow titled Fibromyalgia: Simple Relief Through Movement. The author compared the muscles of a person with fibromyalgia to wet concrete. She stated that if muscles aren't moved frequently, they can stiffen and set, just like real concrete does. She explained how movement can assist with feeling better from the pain of fibromyalgia.
I found this book to be extraordinarily helpful. It distinguished between "movement" and "activity" on the one hand and "exercise". I learned that I would feel worse if I stayed in one position for too long.
I began to pay attention to how long I was sitting in a meeting, working at a computer, or even lying down and resting. I found that a change in position, moving around, or walking briefly, meant less soreness and stiffness.
**Self-Help and Guaifenesin**
Shortly after reading the book, I started exploring the About.com section on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and fibromyalgia. This is where I found out about the CFIDS Self-Help course, now called the CFIDS & Fibromyalgia Self-Help course. The course was described as a "blending of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with group support and principles of self-management".
The description was appealing to me, because it seemed consistent with what I was gradually learning: that I was the best manager of my condition and could learn what was helpful and what was harmful to me. I signed up.
I found in the class that there were other people like me across the US and in other countries. Plus, there seemed to be hope, as specific behaviors were identified that could help to manage the symptoms. The course textbook alone would have been a benefit, but to have a group that worked through the chapters together was even better.
I also continued to explore the CFS/FMS section of About.com. It was here that I first read about the guaifenesin protocol, and people who claimed wonderful responses to this treatment. I checked out a linked website: [www.fibromyalgiatreatment.com](http://www.fibromyalgiatreatment.com) . I was intrigued, so I ordered the source book, *What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Fibromyalgia*, by Dr. Paul St. Amand.
I started the guaifenesin protocol on my own, as I am a nurse and since I had taken guaifenesin previously for coughs. After only a few days, I noticed that I had some energy again. My energy kept improving for the first month or so, and I didn't seem to have any of the expected worsening symptoms.
But then I experienced the first of several "reversal cycles," in which my symptoms worsened and I felt as bad as before starting the treatment. But these have faded over time and I credit guaifenesin with helping to improve my quality of life.
**What Works for Me**
In the initial years after my fibromyalgia diagnosis, I encountered various treatments, activities, and learning experiences. I really wanted something to "cure" my fibromyalgia. I wanted to get rid of this condition, like taking an antibiotic for an infection.
I know now there is no single panacea for treating this condition. But I have discovered ways of being and coping that have worked for me in managing my health with fibromyalgia. Here is what I have learned so far, what I have found helps me:
**Resting **- I rest when I need it, and also when I think I don't need it. When I listen to my body, it tells me when I need to rest. I do much better when I listen and respond appropriately than when I ignore what I am trying to tell myself. I had to learn to rest, as I was used to using my time "productively."
I had to learn to stop and rest, and use the self-help course's definition of rest: lying down with eyes closed in a quiet environment. Being on the phone or watching TV while lying down did not qualify as rest.
**Sleeping well at night **- My outlook on life improves dramatically when I have had a good night's sleep. In contrast, if I am awake all night or even part of the night, the next day is difficult.
To help me sleep better, I had to quit staying up late, eliminate stressful evening activities (like being on the phone), and identify what could help me get a good night's sleep. This includes going to bed by 10 p.m., taking 20 to 30 minutes for reading or prayer, and using medications, as described in the next section.
**Taking medication as needed **- Besides the daily Guaifenesin, I take Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or Acetominophen (Bylenol) during the day for headaches or pain as needed. I also have two prescription medications, including a muscle relaxant that I take at night, which helps me to go to sleep and stay asleep.
**Using low heat **- Either a heating pad or an electric blanket, depending on how much and where I ache. If I turn the heat up past low, I start to feel worse. A warm bath also helps!
**Avoiding certain foods **- I read the Sugarbusters book, The Zone, and the dietary guidelines in the book on guaifenesin. While I don't adhere to all their principles, I do feel better when I keep to the guidelines than when I don't, particularly in avoiding foods with white sugar.
**Moving/activity **- I feel better if I take "walk breaks" at work or have some sort of change in position if I have been sitting for more than 30 minutes. As mentioned earlier, I learned this from reading Stacie Bigelow's book. Mild stretching in the mornings or in the evenings also helps to decrease some of the aches and soreness, particularly in my lower back.
**Being aware of how I feel **- Denying my pain and not paying attention to myself and how I feel can lead to my feeling worse, so I have learned to adjust and do what helps me. At the same time, it doesn't help me to ruminate on how bad I feel, because then I feel worse and notice the pain more.
**Limiting social activities and having a quiet home life **- Being around a lot of people can be draining and I am in that situation every day at work. So when I get home, I usually just keep to myself. It helps me to be at home in quiet surroundings and to be peaceful. I can catch up with others as needed on Facebook or through email.
**Planning for work **- It helps me to have some control over my work hours. Having to be at work very early or staying late is hard on me but manageable one or two times a week, as long as I plan for how I will make up for it on other days. Also, I have learned that I am more effective if I set a limited number of priorities for each day. Otherwise, the details can overwhelm me.
**Reframing **- I don't have control over what happens in my day, but I am working on determining how I will react to what happens. Sometimes that means choosing not to react or not to respond. For example, I get a lot of emails at work that contain new assignments or requests for information. Some are rather demanding.
If I responded immediately to every one of them, I would spend time and energy on things that may be better handled another way. Now I choose whether to respond immediately or answer later when I have had an opportunity to think it through or talk with others first.
Sometimes I choose not to answer at all, and that has helped me on several occasions. I have either followed up with a phone or a conversation in person to explain. These strategies have often kept me from reacting negatively to uninvited demands.
**Scheduling in recovery time **- By scheduling planned time to rest, I can help defray some of the excesses as they come up. For example, if I have to stay late at work one day, then I may leave early the following day.
Likewise, when I have company during holidays, I set aside days before or after when I can have time by myself to rest. By planning for and scheduling my needed recovery time in advance, I am more likely to stick to it. This strategy helps me decrease additional pain or flares from overdoing.
**Seeking help from outside sources **- When life became too much for me, I sought help from outside sources. I have participated in some online and in-person 12 step groups, and I have had a wonderful counselor. Both were extraordinarily positive experiences.
Also, allowing and requesting help from others has been helpful. Sometimes this has resulted in positive development for others, as well as decreasing my burden tremendously.
**Praying/meditation **- I have found that particularly in times of increased symptoms, simply to be quiet and reflect or pray can have a very calming effect.
**Scheduling massages **- It may be painful at the time, but I usually feel better afterwards.
**Utilizing aromatherapy **- Particularly lavender and some of the citrus scents, either in candles that I burn or in lotions.
**Taking the self-help follow-up courses and participating in the alumni group **- I participate in two groups that were offered to graduates of the introductory CFIDS & Fibromyalgia Self-Help class: followup courses and an alumni group. The followup courses focus on helping people reach short-term goals. Despite knowing what I need to do to manage fibromyalgia, putting it into practice is not always easy.
The followup courses have been one of the best opportunities for putting knowledge into practice through making weekly targets. Even when I don't meet my targets, I learn more about myself and what I can do to manage this condition.
The alumni group provides an opportunity for ongoing support plus discussion of topics related to living with chronic illness. We all continue to learn from each other through our responses. We also can keep up with one another through the monthly "check-ins" with our responses.
**Making a NOT TO DO list **- I pickup up this wonderful idea for me from one of the other articles on this site! It helped to know what things I consciously wanted to avoid.
**Conclusion**
Over all, my quality of life has improved dramatically using the strategies I've described. I rate myself currently at 90 on the CFS & Fibromyalgia Rating Scale. I am not back to "normal," but I've learned that that is OK. I don't want to be as driven as I was before getting fibromyalgia.
I have a clearer understanding now of my boundaries and I do well as long as I stay inside them. It took some time, but I finally learned that I have to respect and honor my body, and listen to the messages it gives me. The messages are to slow down, to learn to "be" and not just "do," and to focus on what is really important. |

# Using Self-Management to Treat CFS | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Editor's Note: This article is reprinted, with permission, from the Winter 2002 issue of ME Essential, the magazine of the ME Association of England. We post it because of the strong parallels between the author's approach and the one we advocate: creating stability by first finding the limits imposed by illness, then living consistently within them by pacing (balancing activity and rest). *
In the winter of 1996, I was just beginning the final year of a PhD when I became ill with what felt like an extreme flu without a head-cold. A visit to my GP resulted in my being given some painkillers, told I had a virus and being sent to bed for a few days.
Sure enough the virus passed and I felt fine again, but within a couple of weeks the symptoms had returned - albeit mildly. I went back to the doctor who prescribed the same again with the same results except that when the virus returned again it was more intense.
After several months of this, I asked to be referred somewhere (not knowing what was wrong with me). This resulted in a battery of blood tests being undertaken and, as they all turned up negative (for anaemia, diabetes and so on). I was referred to the local hospital around 11 months after I first became ill.
Further blood tests were carried out there and I was told that, under a diagnosis by exclusion, I had Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or Post-Viral Fatigue Syndrome, commonly known [in England] as ME. I was told that there was no known cure except for time and adequate rest.
They did give me some tricyclic antidepressants for problems I was having sleeping but, as these affected me 24 hours a day, I soon stopped taking them. I unsuccessfully tried several other things though: light-box therapy, St. John's Wort, keeping a food diary and Evening Primrose Oil.
After several months, I progressed through hospital to the Psychiatry department where I was introduced to Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). I was the first person from the Cambridge ME group to get to this point, although many members had been referred to the local hospital and ended up in many different places or nowhere at all.
I put this down to several things: first, the hospital had no standard procedure for ME sufferers; second, persistently asking to be made better; third, luck.
**Cognitive Behavioural Therapy**
CBT is a combination of two therapies: Cognitive Therapy and Behavioural Therapy. The former seems to be a kind of limited psychiatry concerned mostly with positive thinking, and the latter modifies the behaviour of the patient.
CBT can be, and has been, used for many illnesses, for example depression, and cancer and is not a cure for either them or ME, but instead an illness/lifestyle management regime.
For chronic fatigue, this consists essentially of a way to manage, and over time increase, daily exertion. ME sufferers tend to cycle through good and bad days in which, respectively, they do as much as possible while the "feeling good" persists or very little as the "feeling bad" takes hold.
Perversely, each of these contributes to the cause of the other: doing too much on a good day almost always leads to a consequent bad day and the rest on those bad days often results in feeling better on subsequent days.
CBT provides a way to flatten out these ups and downs, to replace the curves with a straight line. The way that it does this is provide a daily exertion total which the sufferer should not exceed on good days and should try to reach on bad days (the behavioural element) and to banish negative thoughts like "why me?", "I'm never going to get well" and so on (the cognitive element).
**My Experience of CBT**
To arrive at an initial daily target, I kept a diary of all exertion, both mental and physical since both can cause great fatigue, dividing it into two classes: Heavy (H) and Light (L) along with Rest (R).
Heavy included trying to think about my thesis, walking and so on, Light might be low-level conversation, about the weather, say, and Rest could include watching something trivial on the telly, or lying in a darkened room listening to a relaxation tape.
After the three weeks were up, I worked out the average amount of H, L and R that I had been managing and this became my daily target.
Within each day, I tried to spread out the exertion so that periods of rest were sandwiched between periods of effort. How long these periods were depended on the task to be done and how I felt. If I spent an hour going round Tescos (H), I might rest for an hour first, but to write a few letters each taking 15 minutes (L), a five minute rest between each could be sufficient.
There is no need to plan the day in advance, although I did find that trying to keep to a similar routine every day helped me to rest often enough while I was trying to work on my thesis, e.g. doing periods of half an hour work and half an hour rest for two hours in the morning and afternoons. You do need to keep a diary, however, to keep track of how much energy you have left for the day.
By managing my rest, I could have energy for more things. In the morning before going to the hospital I spent time reading in bed and, when I got back, I spent a lot of time resting before going out in the evening.
CBT allows you to "save" your energy in this way, over the course of a day, so that, for instance, you could do nothing all day in order to go out in the evening. I found that doing this occasionally was fine but still made me feel worse on following days.
After two or three weeks of doing the CBT, if the daily targets are being met consistently, then they can be increased. If they are being missed by a long way, then they can be reduced, or stay the same until such time as they are being met consistently. The increments might only be five extra minutes a day.
When I did increase, it felt like real progress. The therapy was initially conducted under guidance from the hospital but, once grasped, the idea is that the patient administers it to themselves. This is even true, to some extent, of the cognitive side of CBT but, as I said earlier, I never had any problems with motivation or negative thoughts and so can't really comment on that.
**Pros and Cons of CBT**
The advantages include:
- there are no drugs
- it is easy to do and you can manage it yourself
- it is flexible
- it allows you to see where your time really goes
- you have numbers (the hours of H and L that you achieve) which give you some objective measure of your progress
- you actually do more - if you have a target of four hours of H and have already done 3.55, then you are inclined to find something to do to fill the five minutes whereas previously you would have just stayed lying on the settee
- you learn to break tasks down into manageable chunks (such as first making a note whenever an idea popped into my head for a few days, then sitting down to write a brief set of notes for the talk I gave over a couple of evenings, then spending several days writing and typing this report)
- a lot of the guilt that goes with having to leave jobs undone is removed. When I was ill and not doing CBT, I would find that towards the end of the day when I was really tired, I would start to feel guilty about not doing enough work on my thesis. Now, when I've done what I can, or what I'm allowed, then I don't feel guilt because the CBT says that I shouldn't do any more work.
The one disadvantage of CBT is that it requires determination and some discipline to keep a daily diary and stick to the exertion targets. Make no mistake, it can be difficult on some days.
The advantages, though, will become apparent when you start to find that you have a more consistent level of energy, that because you didn't go mad and swim 50 laps of the local swimming pool the other day, you've managed to get that letter to Granny finished and now have 15 minutes to spend on yourself.
**Conclusions**
When I started CBT, I was doing around three hours of H, four hours of L and eight hours of R. This may sound a lot but is nothing compared to a person who does a 9-5 job but, when you start to keep a diary and see how much energy you actually fritter away yourself, seems quite reasonable.
After doing it for just over 12 months, I am now well enough to be working part-time, have nearly finished my thesis, have been discharged from the hospital and no longer keep a daily diary, just an occasional one. I am not cured or recovered.
I am still tired all the time, still cannot think deeply without a great amount of effort, still in pain and still lose concentration - but I feel very much like I'm heading in the right direction and that this is due in no small part to the environment created by doing CBT.
CBT is not, nor does it claim to be, a cure but it gives an improvement in quality of life, a crutch to lean on and, above all, gives you back some time (five minutes a day is 30 minutes a week, two hours a month...). In the absence of a cure, I'll settle for that.
*Magazine Editor's Note: James is now almost fully recovered and is working full-time once again. He doesn't know to what extent the CBT was responsible for his recovery but it seems to have been a positive experience. In his own words "I still get tired but ME doesn't rule my life."*

# Getting the Most from Limited Energy | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Nancy is a fibromyalgia patient from California. She has led many self-help groups, including being a moderator in the CFIDS and Fibromyalgia Self-Help Program. *
I used to think of routines as unpleasant and restrictive, but since becoming ill, I have found that they are essential to my quality of life. I have learned that far from being unpleasant straight jackets, routines are a way to make the best use of my time and my energy.
**How Illness Changed My Ideas about Routine**
I used to think it was confining to do a certain thing at a certain time every day or to keep projects tidy while I worked on them. I also resented being "a slave to the clock," and I imagined that I had more freedom when I acted on impulse instead of carefully planning my time. But all those beliefs changed when I got sick.
Illness imposed limits on me and I learned that I have to measure out my daily energy very carefully. I do this through such practices as having a daily schedule, getting regular exercise, taking my medicines, and eating a healthy diet.
In all this, having habitual actions and routines enables me to use discipline to get the most out of my limited energy. Using regular routines is a way to take good care of myself and, also, a source of pride.
**My Routines**
Even though I'm a great believer in the usefulness of routines, I recognize that each person will have to develop ones that fit his or her unique situation. As one example, here are some of the routines that help me:
- Laying out a complete outfit (including underwear and socks) the night before. If I know I will be extra busy for several days in a row, I assemble several complete outfits on hangers.
- Breaking up my bedtime routines into several parts, doing some of them early in the evening, some later, and a few just before bedtime. For example, I have my clothes laid out and my CPAP humidifier filled early in the evening. (See next item for an explanation of CPAP.)
I shower and put on a robe after dinner. I take my evening medications when I shower. At bedtime I just have to get into sleep wear and put on my CPAP mask.
- Having a set time to maintain my CPAP and fill its humidifier. (I have sleep apnea, which means that my airway collapses when I fall deeply asleep, cutting off my breath. To counteract this, I use a small machine called a CPAP, which stands for Continuous Positive Airway Pressure.
A hose connects the machine to a mask I wear tightly over my mouth and nose during the night. The CPAP blows pressurized air up my nose all night, "splinting" my airway open. Because the airway is clear, I don't experience apneas, or periods of no breathing.)
- Doing my swimming in the early evening. On the days I swim, I can shower once, at the pool, saving getting wet twice.
- Pacing my level of physical activity. For example, I skip swimming if my active grandsons are coming for a visit. I remind myself that the purpose of exercise is to build up my health, so I don't want to tear it down by overdoing it.
- Taking my morning medications and getting fully dressed before I leave the bedroom in the morning.
- Keeping a short hairdo that needs little maintenance.
- Buying clothes that are easy to put on (front-hook bras, and socks that go on easily, for example). I also buy easy-to-care-for clothes. I save time by minimizing hand washing and ironing.
- Using a stool in the shower and another one in the kitchen.
- Keeping track of activities and appointments in a 3" X 4" notebook that I carry in my handbag. I always have it on hand, so I can make entries immediately.
- Keeping two sports bottles of water at places in the house where I sit. I used to keep just one in each location, but then I was always having to get up to refill it or (worse!) asking my husband to do it for me.
I found that when I used two bottles I could set out the empty one to take with me when I had to get up for some other reason. I could refill it and return it before the second one was empty.
- Buying a new appointment book each fall, and entering into it family birthdays, and anniversaries. In the back of the book I list phone numbers for my GP, my pharmacy, my vet, my medical equipment provider, my scooter repair person, and nearby family and friends.
- Putting things away as soon as I am through with them, such as disposing of the newspaper as soon as I finish reading it, and carrying my plate to the sink after a meal. This means disciplining myself not to just set something down anywhere but instead to put it in its proper place.
- Doing big tasks in stages with rests in between. For example, if I have lots of things to put away after grocery shopping, I will put the frozen goods in the freezer, then take a rest; put other items in the refrigerator, then take a rest; etc.
- Sorting the mail as soon as I bring it into the house, and putting much of it directly into the waste basket. I have a set place for bills and another for magazines or other mail I want to read later.
- Having "transfer stations" at various places in my house where I can leave items destined to go somewhere else. I leave items on the hall table that are eventually going to the bedroom, for example. I pick them up and take them with me when I have to go back there, saving me an extra trip just to put them away.
- Glancing around before I stand up to see if I can take any misplaced items with me. On bad days it seems that the only housework I accomplish is keeping things in their places. But that is important!
- Getting rid of clutter. At one time, our house became so messy that I was embarrassed to have people over. But, by making changes a little bit at a time, I was able to create a neat and orderly house. (See the article "Illness and Housekeeping.")
- Keeping meals simple. My rule is that I should have no more than one complicated dish (such as a salad or a casserole) and the other items have to be easy to fix, such as frozen vegetables or pre-baked rolls.
- Putting left over cooking ingredients away while I am cooking, and soaking pots and pans as soon as they are emptied.
- Clearing the table after meals by having each person takes his or her own plate (and maybe a serving dish or two) to the sink.
- Wiping up spills and dirty footprints quickly.
- Keeping the laundry from piling up by doing a load or two as soon as the hampers begin to fill. I have a set of three canvas laundry bags hanging on a rack: one for dark colors, one for whites, and one for medium colors. As soon as one fills up, I wash that load.
- Folding laundry while sitting on a bench by the bureaus in the bedroom, and putting folded clothes directly into the drawers. I keep a box of hangers nearby, and I put clothes for the closets on hangers as I take them out of the laundry basket.
- Setting aside two fifteen-minute periods a day for meditating, and adding extra rest periods when my energy is low.
- Whenever possible, planning errands and shopping trips so I can stay at home at least every other day
**Dealing with the Unexpected**
All too frequently, something unexpected comes up that adds to my burden of stress and drains my already limited physical and emotional energy. I have found that my routines help me deal with such events.
A big part of my approach to unexpected events are to prepare for them. If I am usually living within my energy envelope and keeping up with tasks like laundry and shopping, I have a reserve for dealing with extra demands.
And, even when I am in the middle of a crisis, I take care not to schedule myself so tightly that I don't have time to increase my rest periods if necessary. Also, I make sure to go to bed at the same time each night and to stay in bed for nine hours.
Sometimes I have a bad week, with too many responsibilities and a rebound of my symptoms. I respond by setting a target, a short-term goal designed to help me get through the week.
"Bad Week" targets can be things like scheduling one or two fifteen-minute rests each day, scaling back on an activity that is apt to push me outside my energy envelope, saying "no" to requests, promising myself something rewarding such as time in the back yard hammock, delegating tasks to others, getting to bed on time, or listening to relaxing music.
Setting an achievable target when everything seems to be sliding downhill improves my outlook. It gives me a positive way I can cope and a reason to congratulate myself!
**Conclusion**
The result of my efforts to incorporate discipline into my life was the realization that routines, far from confining me, grant me the energy and the time I need to live a happy and worthwhile life.
My use of routines was part of a general coping strategy I have used: to see my situation in terms of challenges rather than afflictions. I try to find a way to turn each problem into a growth opportunity. Adopting routines as a response to having less energy was one of those opportunities.

# Learning to Manage Fibromyalgia | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Denise Le Clair, a graduate of the CFIDS/Fibromyalgia Self-Help course, is an FMS patient from Omaha and the mother of three children. She works full time as a writing tutor at Creighton University and also teaches study skills at a community college. *
I have suffered from the pain, confusion, and exhaustion of Fibromyalgia for over 30 years. Since I was diagnosed only 10 years ago, I didn't have a name to explain my symptoms for most of the time I have been ill.
Nevertheless, my life now is vastly improved over my life before diagnosis. I still have bad flares and I still get discouraged, but now I manage the disorder.
**Life With FMS Before a Diagnosis**
I believe my FMS started when I fell down a flight of concrete stairs at age 17. After the fall, I started having serious problems getting solid sleep, and over the following years, experienced increased fatigue, terrible headaches, and an inability to walk without pain or with endurance.
Not having a medical explanation for my symptoms, I felt a sense of shame. I tried to find reasons for my inability to keep up: I must be out of shape physically, or stressed from being a college student, then a new mother, and finally teaching while running a household.
But the pain and stiffness in my hips, legs and feet became so bad that I could not walk down stairs without holding on to the walls or around the block without being worn out. I sought medical help, but the doctors, who were for the most part kind, were puzzled and offered little beyond a pep talk and orthotics, which made the pain in my feet and hips much worse.
I decided I must not be a very good person, a fraud. I often felt there was a wall between myself and others. I existed with a kind of disconnect socially and with my own body.
I see now that the feelings of distance from others and not being in my body was how I coped with the constant pain--but it used all the energy I had. I came to believe that the pain and fatigue I had was the result of either innate laziness or an emotional disorder.
**Diagnosis Opens the Doors to a New Life**
Finally, when I was 40, I was diagnosed, thanks to an astute GP who put all the symptoms together. I soon experienced some improvement after several months of physical therapy and daily over the counter pain medication.
Two years later, a consultation with a rheumatologist added sleep medication. I have a caring doctor now who has helped me through several unsuccessful trials of pain medication and who supports my efforts to help myself.
Last summer I consulted with a psychologist who specializes in pain management and, although we disagreed on some points, the sessions re-confirmed the value of the strategies I have developed over the years, gave me a useful vocabulary for the symptoms of FMS (like fibro fog for cognitive confusion and fibro funk for times I am worn out and fed up), and most importantly, allowed me to fully explore how I feel about having a chronic but hidden illness.
**A New Perspective**
Getting a diagnosis and slowly accepting that I have a chronic disorder has meant a new perspective. Now I manage all aspects of my life--from the work I do to the bra I wear (no underwires!)--in terms of how it effects the FMS.
A good diet, quality sleep, daily, planned rests, and careful pacing along with some medications (both prescription drugs and supplements) have been vital for my improved health. I've also made a variety of other changes.
For example, I use a massaging showerhead on a flexible hose to ease tight, sore muscles. Because sitting makes me very stiff, I get up and move around every so often at home and at work and make sure I take a short walk everyday.
I let my family know my limits, but now that I plan how I will use my energy, I am able to do much more with them. I do not wear myself out so quickly that we do not enjoy outings or get the housework done. I pay attention to how my body reacts and modify as I need to--and because I have been willing to make changes, I have more enjoyment in my life now than I did before.
I have realized that, for me, looking for recovery is too discouraging and adds one more burden--a judgment that I didn't "try hard enough" to get well--no matter that the condition is hardly understood by the medical community. That is not to say I do not seek more information or that I am not willing to try new therapies.
Certainly since my initial diagnosis more is understood about CFS/FMS, and more appropriate and beneficial treatments are available. I experiment and evaluate, using what helps and ignoring the rest and remind myself that FMS is real, serious disorder and I am not "faking it," a malingerer, or a whiner.
Furthermore, I am beginning to sort out the FMS from other health problems. For example, the diagnosis of IBS just did not feel right to me, so I consulted an allergist and uncovered several food sensitivities. The FMS is not gone--but the IBS is.
I look back now and give myself credit for all I did accomplish: three children, two college degrees, being a La Leche League leader, surviving a difficult marriage and establishing a life as a single mom.
Just as in my life before I was diagnosed, I am active in my church, work, run a household, read voraciously, dance, enjoy friends, but I no longer push myself and carefully plan how to use the very precious energy I have.
My life now is vastly improved over my life before diagnosis because my attitude has changed about how to measure my worth. I have an illness I must accommodate, but my worth is not measured in loads of laundry or hours of work, but in the happiness I find in myself and give to others.
**The Bottom Line: I've Learned to Manage FMS**
My adaptations have not cured me of FMS. I still have bad flares and I still get discouraged, but I have learned how to manage the disorder, so I am no longer overwhelmed. There are, of course, days I wonder how I can possibly endure the pain and fatigue (this is a serious part of the destruction of self-esteem). Then I remember I've endured the same, and worse.
Now I know and use a variety of strategies like those I have described that help me get through rough times. I have sought whatever help I could to understand and manage this disorder including the self-help course which was very useful. And I make sure I find a way to enjoy other people. It's a balancing act I wish I did not have to make. The fact that I must does not diminish me. That I do deepens my life. |

# Physical and Psychological Recovery from CFS | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Margaret Fergusson is a CFS patient from Scotland. A graduate of the CFIDS & Fibromyalgia Self-Help course, she is retired from a 35-year career as a biochemist with the National Health Service. *
When CFS forced me to stop working, I was functioning at 15% of normal. Now, three years later, I am back to about 70% and I have found a peace in the new, somewhat limited me.
**Descent into Illness, Starting the Journey Back**
My descent into CFS began with a viral throat infection. The infection stayed on as a devastating fatigue, intolerance of exercise, aches and pains and an inability to think. I fought the fatigue and ignored the pain, but I had no answer for the thick gray fog that crept into my brain every day.
I accommodated by doing work needing deep thought early in the week and early in the day, when I was at my best. But each week the fogged days came earlier and the fog came earlier in the day. Finally, I realized that I could no longer do my job and that it was unsafe to drive, so I stopped working, ending a 35 year career with the National Health Service in Scotland.
A diagnosis came gradually. Two doctors suspected Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, but it was only nine months later that a Consultant Physician confirmed their suspicions. During that time, I educated myself about CFS (or ME as it is called in the United Kingdom) and I made one important change to my daily routine: taking an afternoon nap.
That one change improved my overall functional level from 15% to 25%. I wanted more, of course, and decided to pursue an idea suggested by the Consultant Physician that I surf the net to find a CBT/self-help course. I found and joined the CFIDS/Fibromyalgia Self-Help program.
**Learning Self-Help**
Through taking the introductory course and participating in the target courses later, I made two major changes in my life that helped me improve my functional level up to 70%. First, I found a way to adjust my activity level to fit the energy level I had at any time.
Second, I learned to be content with my life, even if it was very different than what I had known and what I had hoped for myself. Living by a weekly plan was crucial to the first. Psychological adjustments, aided by my meditation practice, were central to the second.
**My Weekly Plan**
The introductory course helped me realize how limited energy is for someone with CFS. I saw that I was the boom and bust type, but that if I could regulate my energy expenditure (live within my energy envelope), I would have a better life. I decided to devise a formal written plan for each week's activities.
Since I was not able to judge my limits in "real time," I wrote out a schedule for myself each week based on my activity level in the recent past. Mornings were set aside for strenuous activities; afternoons for rest and undemanding activities; evenings for pleasurable activities.
To fill the slots, I reflect on how things went last week. I can now tell intuitively if the week as a whole has too much in it. I am well enough now to get away with an occasional busy week and to be able to judge if I need to plan a quiet week.
A mixture of intuition, body awareness and plain common sense helps me decide if I can increase my activity level or whether an increase in symptoms suggests that I should ease off a bit.
I use logging sporadically to define and redefine my limits as my health improves. The plan is a pre-emptive log, in the sense that writing my limits down in detail on paper helps me to stay within them.
Here's a sample plan for a week when I was at a functional level of 50%. "DIY" on Tuesday refers to Do It Yourself, meaning jobs like painting, decorating, fixing fences, and so on. I used to lie in bed working out how I could divide these jobs into tiny pieces to do one little bit at a time. As I improved the little bits got bigger.

Using this written plan has a number of advantages. First, it provides discipline, controlling changes in what I am able to do and preventing me from going back to the boom and bust scenario. Second, it makes it easier for me to ask my family for help with "energy expensive" jobs. Third, it gives me a sense of achievement when I stay within my limits.
**Acceptance**
The plan ensures that my physical and intellectual activities are kept within limits; it may even make me seem to be a sort of robot. I consult my little piece of paper and act accordingly. It has been helpful in that way, but I still had to address feelings of loss and anger triggered by CFS. After all, CFS had changed me in the space of a few weeks from being a "supermom" into a semi-invalid.
Instituting my plan gave me enough energy to address the emotional issues. I had to accept that my life had changed drastically. I had lost a huge part of my role in my family and I had stopped working. Life has changed more in the three years since I developed CFS than ever before. I made it my goal to become comfortable with myself just as I am now, in this present moment.
I think two attributes from my life prior to CFS helped me to make this adjustment.
**Persistence**: The tendency to keep plugging along is deeply engrained in my nature and helped me adjust to CFS. My persistence has paid off. I have a lifestyle that lets me live in harmony with CFS.
**Previous Health Problem**: I inherited an eye problem, which allows me to use only one eye. I learned that I had to work out my own way of doing things to compensate for the problem. Eventually, compensating was instinctive.
**Meditation**
Meditation has been crucial to my adjustment. I started meditating five years before I developed CFS, but I had to adapt my practice to meditating with CFS. I learned to wait for lucid spells before trying to practice the formal meditations I had been taught. I now use three types of meditation.
**Meditation on the breath**: I pay attention to my breath going in and out of my body, for periods of 20 up to 45 minutes. I have found this practice to be a great stress buster. Even when I feel as if I have been distracted, a deep calmness carries over into the rest of the day.
**Meditation on loving-kindness**: This meditation fosters feelings of kindness towards myself, towards others (including those with whom you have conflicts) and eventually all creatures.
Developing feelings of kindness towards myself and others is a great practice for when I am being forgetful or clumsy; it stops the negative self-view that I am just a stupid old woman. This practice was also good for dealing with relationship problems. At one time, I had a "waiting list" of people I didn't get on with very well!
**Just Sitting**: I meditate on the breath to quiet the chatter in my mind, then I sit and just notice what thoughts arise and what I am feeling. Making a quiet space helps subtle thoughts and emotions rise into consciousness. By getting these things out in the open I got to the source of the compulsive boom and bust behaviour.
**Lessons from Meditation**
I learned that just creating a quiet space to be with the fog and the pains was useful in helping me come to terms with symptoms.
Meditation helped me let go of my "work" self. My long working life had come to an abrupt and unplanned end because of CFS. I used a sort of visualisation to wind all that up and say goodbye to it.
I focused my meditation on letting go of a lot of the attributes I thought of as me: the mom, the scientist, the person who could always cope. I used meditation to value the person I was now.
While meditating I noticed that I was grateful for having developed CFS because I was able to value a lot of good things (like stillness) that I had ignored.
Meditation helps me be in touch with myself but not in a self obsessed way. (In effect, I am saying "This is how I am." I am not being judgmental about it) The input from meditation helps me decide how active I can be in any given week. Meditation has helped me to accept CFS at a deep intuitive level so I can be comfortable with being a very different person from the one I was a few years ago.
**Conclusion**
Coping with the changes wrought by CFS have made me focus on me, not on the roles of wife mother and scientist that I have played. Learning to accept myself as just fine the way I am, learning that my old driven way of life was unhealthy, has brought me a great sense of contentment.
CFS is part of me I am prepared to welcome it on board and appreciate it for the valuable lessons it has taught me and is still teaching me.
Update: The author wrote us in 2012 to say that she has been ordained into the Tiratana Buddhist Order and now uses the name Danabhadri. Updating her status, she wrote:
"With time my envelop got bigger and bigger. I can do a lot provided I listen to my own body and let myself be guided by intuition born of experience. I can cook for 30 people for a week, I can do financial work one day a week and, best of all, I can help teach classes."
"I feel very blessed not just because I have made such a good recovery but because I have had the experience of having had so much of what I looked on as me taken away. That experience plus the coping mechanisms I learned from this programme are helping me go forward with confidence and with gratitude to all who have helped me to reach this point." |

After struggling with CFIDS/FM for six years, I finally realized no superperson in a red cape was going to appear to rescue me. After much reflection and many false starts, I built a life that works for me.
**Initial Efforts to Cope**
When the odyssey into chronic illness began. I was healthy, athletic, had a full-time job, and my children were on their own. Single for five years, I was enjoying life. A sudden bout with bursitis in a hip soon changed everything. Migrating leg pain, aching feet, muscle cramps, neurological symptoms and brain fog followed, as did the frustration of being referred from doctor to doctor.
Passing off unexplained symptoms to age and boredom, I moved from the suburbs to San Francisco. I alternately continued to lead a normal life, then endure flares without witness. Eventually, I retreated into the comfort of my home, despite the advantages of living in a world-class city.
Considering myself a trooper, I didn't like bothering others with my illness. On good days, I thought maybe people were right -- I wasn't ill. Increasingly, I hid fatigue and nausea, dulled the pain with Ultram, then suffered consequences for days afterward, only to gear up for the next active encounter and lonely crash. It never occurred to me that I was doing damage, possibly delaying recovery.
The pain, stiffness, cramps, activity intolerance and cognitive problems were getting worse. For awhile, I couldn't remember my phone number. I became aware that my judgment was flawed; I made decisions quickly, choosing what brought the least physical pain or mental stress.
It was then that I was forced to re-evaluate my circumstances, to question assumptions and expectations and come to terms with a condition that only I could influence.
**Taking Control**
After a hard look at my situation, I realized that living in easier surroundings would actually allow me to conserve energy and be less house-bound. I moved back to the suburbs to be near my daughter.
I found a support group and gained new friends who had CFIDS/FM, people like me who didn't mind sharing trials, treatments and triumphs, and who understood the value of serenity and patience. Through the group, I found a doctor and other resource people.
I also saw that others with serious health challenges could live a full life by respecting their bodies and feelings, by creating reasonable new goals, and adhering to a few guidelines. Dr. Bruce Campbell's extremely helpful CFIDS & Fibromyalgia Self-Help course gave me additional ways to actively improve my life.
But I still found staying within my energy envelope was haphazard at best, until I devised a reminder. Writing down the five most important things I could do to make life better --Pacing, Resting regularly, keeping myself and others Informed, Delegating and making time for pure Enjoyment.
I formed the acronym P.R.I.D.E. and stuck it on my mirror, a daily reminder that I could live my life so that health and self-esteem were not sacrificed.
**P. R. I. D. E.**
Even though I'm not perfect and fall off the wagon frequently, I'm always grateful to have this wagon to climb back onto, and it carries me down the road:
**Pacing**
Pacing has become rote now, because the miserable physical consequences of overdoing, like Pavlov's bell, have trained me well. Each day I check my task priority list and order the day according to how much energy each task requires, leaving plenty of blank, or spill-over, time.
If there are several things to accomplish, I start with the most important one first as insurance that it will get done. After dressing and before activities, I take time to sit and relax, read the newspaper, watch Ms. Stewart tour a pottery factory, or have a cup of tea. Then I work on projects in small bites, taking lots of rest breaks.
If I need to put off something, I do, and re-order my week without guilt. A kitchen timer reminds me to shift activities often, not to overdo sitting or standing, to alternate between sedentary and active tasks such as working on taxes and watering plants. No longer comparing my efficiency with that of a well person, I devised my own work ethic.
As I became more comfortable with altered routine, I wrote down the things I accomplished, and was pleasantly surprised at the many things I did do, despite being ill. It took me years, but I finished the novel I began twenty years ago, something I probably would not have done without having CFIDS/FM.
Rest
Rest takes the form of taking mental and physical breaks from any activity. For me, mornings require more rest. The early afternoon hours are the most productive. Lying down for 60 minutes around 4:30 pm offers my body relief from gravity and energizes my evenings. Getting to bed at 9 pm allows time to get sleepy by reading or listening to soft music such as Steven Halpern's music CDs for sound healing.
I've learned that scheduling rest hours (or even days) before and after heavy activities is mandatory. I no longer push through bad days, but take as much rest as necessary. I've come to depend on the obvious benefits of more energy and less pain in the days that follow.
Informing
Informing myself and others includes four areas: listening to my body, subscriptions and books, informing friends and family, gathering and giving information through media.
I now pay more attention to what my body is telling me, using Bruce Campbell's journaling techniques until I see fixable patterns, such as weather-related or activity-related flares.
I subscribe to journals such as the CFIDS Chronicle from the CFIDS Association of America and Arthritis Today from Arthritis Foundation for fibromyalgia. I find books by empathetic doctors who have CFIDS/FM themselves, very helpful. Two of my favorites are Living with M.E. by Dr. Charles Shepherd, and Dr. Devin Starlanyl's Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain Syndrome.
I also invested in the reference book Prescription for Nutritional Healing, by Phyllis Balch, CNC, and James Balch, M.D., which recommends vitamins, minerals, herbs and supplements plus other helpful tips for dealing with health problems.
I no longer wait for people to bring up the subject and now talk to friends and family matter-of-factly about how this condition affects me and how they can help, such as scheduling short activities in the middle of the day, reminding me not to overdo, finding restaurants with soft chairs, or remembering that wine no longer agrees with me.
I also stress that overprotection isolates and demeans me; I will gratefully accept or decline an invitation according to my needs at the time.
In the public domain, I occasionally do some internet surfing, staying with reliable sources such as National Library of Medicine, New England Journal of Medicine, and Medline (accessed through "webMD.com"). The books and journals listed above also list internet and other resources for information and products. Occasionally, I reply to relevant news media stories to encourage their interest in following up.
**Delegating **
Delegating is difficult when living alone, and it gets expensive to pay people to do everything. Often, people don't know how to help. Since I enjoy helping people, I realized that to deny someone that opportunity is not right, either. Since I often can't remember when asked off-hand what would be helpful, I make a list as items occur to me.
I've employed students and neighborhood teens for digging, moving furniture and planting. Finally, having been a committee member, chairperson and officer throughout life, I am mindful now not to volunteer or be flattered into elected service. I hope to get back to that form of participation again one day, but for now, saying "No" tactfully is a form of delegating.
**Enjoyment **
Enjoyment and pleasure are crucial to anyone's health. For those of us who are time-challenged by chronic illness, it's easy to let routine or "catch up" activities dominate, forgetting to schedule pure pleasure.
Yet diversion from routine, pain and solitude in the form of joy, laughter and companionship has lasting benefits. I've found that lunch or dinner out, a drive to the coast, a phone call to someone I haven't heard from recently, gardening, or buying a new music CD all make this condition more bearable for me.
My daughter makes a point of bringing my grandbabies over to visit when I am not well enough to visit or to baby sit. Also, she asks me out to a movie (albeit a short, quiet one) on occasion. Often, getting out of my home when I feel physically awful and being with people, even if it is sitting in a coffee shop for awhile, makes me feel better.
**Conclusion**
With time, I've discovered by trial and error that I can and deserve to have reasonable control over an ever-present illness and, some of the time at least, I can choose what its effects will be. Now, the positive reward of better days and the hope of recovery keep me on track, honoring my needs, rather than following someone else's drummer.
I know there are still things I can't do, but life is a banquet; I can't eat it all, anyway. However, by choosing an appropriate lifestyle, reminding myself to have P.R.I.D.E. in my life, I can accomplish many goals.

# The Healing Power of Gratitude | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Joan Buchman is a fibromyalgia patient from California. She is a long-time moderator in the CFIDS & Fibromyalgia Self-Help Program.*
I struggled with fibromyalgia for eight years before achieving stability. Little did I suspect in my eighth year with FMS that a crisis was coming that would upset that stability or that help would come from a simple daily exercise.
**Adapting to Fibromyalgia**
My fibromyalgia began when I developed muscle pain in my upper body. Then I started having problems with my sleep, waking up several times during the night and feeling totally exhausted in the morning.
After months of visits to a number of doctors, I was finally diagnosed with FMS. I was relieved to find a name to go with my symptoms, but after that initial euphoria, was left with the task of learning how to live with this debilitating and chronic illness.
I spent the next few years experiencing the stages of grieving and over time came a long way toward acceptance of my condition, creating a life within the limits of this illness. My regimen included reading all I could about my illness, resting, and learning what kinds of exercise I could do without exacerbating my condition.
I also joined a local FMS support group, became good friends with other FMS patients and re-evaluated which activities and relationships were causing me stress, making some changes.
I gradually improved to where most days, physically, I was between 40% and 60% of my functioning before FMS. Physically, mentally and emotionally, I had crafted a life that worked for me and my illness; I was feeling the best I had in many years.
**Family Crisis Upsets a Delicate Balance**
Then a family crisis arose that upset the delicate balance I had so carefully created. Suddenly, a previously slow-growing thyroid cancer that my husband's sister, Janette, had been living with for over 20 years, became active and very fast moving. After unsuccessful chemotherapy, the cancer had spread to her liver and she was going downhill quickly.
My husband and I asked her to come live with us, which she accepted. For the next 5-1/2 months, until her death, we lived together, sharing the ups and downs, the laughter and tears, the hope and the fear.
As Janette's primary caregiver, I was unable to continue with my daily routine of exercise, regular resting and social activities. The high stress and the loss of my routine led to some increase in pain and fatigue.
The stress of caregiving for those months affected me emotionally more than anything. Seeing someone I loved fading before my eyes was very difficult. During this crisis, the emotional support I needed came from an unexpected source.
**Help from a Simple Exercise**
A few months before Janette came to live with us, I was browsing in a local bookstore while doing Christmas shopping. I spotted a book titled "The Simple Abundance Journal of Gratitude." I recognized Sarah Ban Breathnach as the author of "Simple Abundance." Most of the book consisted of a page for each day of the year, followed by five blank lines.
I was intrigued by her idea that there could be powerful effects from writing each day five things you were grateful for. I bought the book as a gift to myself, little knowing what a significant role that small book would play in helping me survive one of the most stressful periods of my life.
For a month and a half before Janette came, I wrote in my Gratitude Journal every day. It was the last thing I did at night before going to sleep. Sometimes I struggled to find 5 things for which I was grateful; occasionally, one of those was, "I'm grateful this day has ended." But I stuck with it.
During the months Janette was with us, I felt it was very important to keep up with the Gratitude Journal and I focused on aspects of this situation from which I could pull out something to be thankful for. Often, it was something Janette was doing to find peace with her life and death. She reached out to just about everyone who had ever been in her life.
In return, she experienced an outpouring of love like I had never seen. She received many letters, phone calls, even visits from old friends who traveled cross-country to see her. At times, this outpouring was overwhelming to her.
But, at the same time, she was so nurtured by it, it helped give her strength to go on. Janette was a constant inspiration, for in her final months, besides reaching out to others, she took time to appreciate her surroundings and the pleasures of everyday life.
We took her to the California Coast one weekend and she was inspired by the nature that was there. She stared at the ocean and the contentment on her face was amazing. Paul took her to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and she loved it. She was reaching out to grasp everything around her, even though she knew she didn't have long to live.
**Learning the Power of Gratitude**
Janette taught me to treasure what I have right now. Gratitude means appreciating what you have and making the most from that. So I began to express in my journal appreciation for people in my life and my life as it was. That led to feelings of gratitude for the lessons I had been learning about myself because of my illness.
I had learned that moving as fast as I could, doing as much as possible, was not making me happy. I was not taking any time to nurture my physical, mental or emotional needs. I believe that my body was shouting at me to slow down and savor life.
I think I would have learned about gratitude on my own by writing the Gratitude Journal for that entire year. But Janette, as a shining example of experiencing gratitude during a crisis, gave me a crash course in finding gratitude in my life.
From Janette's model of living her last days with grace and appreciation of everything she had right then, I learned that I can live a happy and peaceful life with my chronic illness.
In fact, I would even say I am grateful for FMS, for without it, I would not have been forced to take a close look at how I was living. My life today is not the life I had imagined, but, looking back, I realize that I was not on a track for happiness and peace. Because of FMS, I have had the opportunity to find out what is really important for me to live a fulfilling and meaningful life.
Gratitude is not about "looking at the bright side" or denying the realities of life. Gratitude goes much deeper than that. It's about learning from a situation, taking the good to help deal with other challenges in the future.
It's about finding out that you have more power over your life than you previously imagined. You can stop being a victim of your circumstances and reach out to the joy in living. If you open your heart to the good in your life, gratitude becomes as much a part of your life as breathing.
So I continue to write in my Gratitude Journal. Only now, I do it in my head, every minute of every day. I do not limit myself to five lines.
The gift I gave myself that Christmas of the Gratitude Journal changed my life. After struggling with FMS for years, searching for answers and cures, I was finally able to reach a level of acceptance that has dramatically improved my quality of life.
I am better at pacing my activities, listening to my body and have more patience with myself and others. I have found joy at every turn, from appreciating the beauty of nature to improved relationships with family and friends.
I still have muscle pain and fatigue. Those symptom levels remain fairly constant. But that journal opened the door to unconditional happiness with the hand I was dealt. I can look beyond the pain and fatigue and look forward to each day and the joy it will bring. And it all started with a book I saw at a bookstore amid the hustle and bustle of Christmas shopping.

# Recovery from CFIDS: What Worked for Me, Part 1 | Treating CFS & FM

|
*(Note: This is an expanded version of an article published in the CFIDS Chronicle as a two-part series in Spring and Summer 2002. The earlier version is also available on the website of the self-help program as *[Using Self-Help to Recover from CFIDS](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/library/using-self-help-recover-cfids). For a lengthier account taking the story through 2018, see [Recovery from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: One Person's Story](http://recoveryfromcfs.org/).)
I became ill with CFIDS in the summer of 1997. My symptoms worsened over the first few months I was ill. During that period I gradually reduced my time at work to 15 hours a week, then stopped working entirely. I functioned at about 25% of my pre-illness level.
Today, five years later, I consider myself to be recovered. I no longer experience symptoms of CFIDS and have an activity level comparable to that of other people of my age. My improvement has been gradual but steady, about one or two percent a month.
I don't know whether my recovery will last, but I am encouraged by the fact that my progress has been reasonably even with no major setbacks.
The path I followed was an unusual one. Believing that there was little that either conventional and alternative medicine had to offer me, I decided to forego the search for a medical cure, instead focusing on what I could do myself to feel better. I write this account of my use of self-help and lifestyle change as a treatment for CFIDS in the hope that others might find encouragement from my experience.
**The Context of Recovery**
My efforts to improve occurred in a context shaped by two important factors over which I had little control. Luckily, both supported my recovery. The first was the severity and complexity of my illness. I had a moderate case of CFIDS. Though significantly limited by the illness, I was slightly better off than the average patient in the severity of my symptoms.
I would also add that it is a mark of the devastation created by CFIDS that having a case which takes away 75% of functioning can be called "moderate." I was also fortunate in having only CFIDS, uncomplicated by other illnesses such as fibromyalgia or chemical sensitivity.
Second, my life circumstances helped promote improvement. I was in my early 50's when I got sick, old enough to have created a financial cushion for myself. I was not stressed by the financial pressures that many CFIDS patients face. Having financial reserves allowed me to quit working and focus on getting better.
Also, I received understanding and support from my family and closest friends. They accepted that my illness was real and supported my decision to pursue improvement in the way I will describe below. The support of a close friend was particularly helpful. We talked frequently about my illness.
Every month, both of us rated my progress on the [CFS & Fibromyalgia Rating Scale](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/cfs-fibromyalgia-rating-scale). The discussions helped me to be more realistic about my progress. Also, her interest in helping me communicated that I wasn't alone in my efforts to improve.
A final element in my life circumstances was the fact that I lived alone. Although it could be frightening on the days I was too sick to get to the grocery store, living alone gave me the opportunity to live my life as I thought necessary for my recovery. I had the freedom to organize my life in the way I believed would maximize my chances for improvement.
In all the ways just described, my situation was helpful to recovery. My illness was moderate in comparison to that of some patients. And my life circumstances were much less stressful than those of some patients. I take no credit for these factors. They were "givens" in my situation, a matter of good luck.
**What Worked For Me**
CFIDS was comprehensive in its effects, touching every aspect of my life from my ability to work to my moods, finances, relationships and hopes for the future. In response, I used a variety of self-help strategies. I believe seven were crucial to my recovery. I'll discuss several of them in this article, then conclude with more in Part 2.
**Accepting Responsibility for Helping Myself**
My response to CFIDS was shaped by my previous experience as a consultant to self-help programs at the Stanford University Medical School. The programs, which were complementary to regular medical care, taught me to ask two questions when facing a health problem: 1) what help does the medical system offer? and 2) how can I help myself?
As soon as I received a CFIDS diagnosis, I went to the local health library. A few hours' reading convinced me that medical resources for CFIDS patients were very limited. It was clear that there was no medical cure for CFIDS. The prospects of developing one in the near future seemed dim, because there was no agreement on the cause of CFIDS and very little money was being put into research.
It was also discouraging to read that there was no standard treatment for CFIDS, that is, no commonly prescribed medication given routinely to CFIDS patients. Rather, patients had to try a variety of different treatments in the hope of finding something that worked.
What one person found helpful might be ineffective with another. I concluded that the best a medical approach had to offer was modest symptom improvement, probably requiring a long period of experimentation.
I decided on the spot to forego that approach. Rather than experimenting with many treatments in the hope of achieving minor symptom improvement, I decided to accept responsibility for getting better. In contrast to an approach with a very uncertain outcome, I felt confident I could find things that would help me improve.
My work at Stanford with medical self-help programs had convinced me that how one lives with chronic illness can change its effects and may even change the course of illness. Since I had an illness for which the medical resources were very limited, I decided to focus on the second question I had learned at Stanford, asking what I could do to help myself.
My decision did not imply a rejection of medicine in general or of my doctor. I checked in with him monthly by phone to keep him apprised of my progress and continued to see him for other medical problems. He was supportive of my approach to CFIDS.
Had my symptoms been more severe, I might have combined a self-help approach with a medical one. But under the circumstances I found myself in, I judged that using self-help exclusively offered me the best chance to control symptoms and improve my quality of life.
**Combining Acceptance of CFIDS with Hope for Improvement**
For more than a year after becoming sick, I wondered whether I should make recovery my goal. I found recovery a hard standard to live with. Having the goal of recovery condemned me to an emotional roller coaster, in which I was encouraged by my progress but devastated by the inevitable setbacks.
The dilemma helped me to understand the distinction between those things I could control and those I couldn't. I finally concluded that whether I recovered was out of my hands, but that there were many things I could do to improve my quality of life.
At the same time, I believed that those things that helped me feel better also could lead to recovery, if that proved possible for me. In other words, I came to believe that recovery was out of my hands. All I could do was to create conditions conducive to it. By suspending expectations about recovery, I could focus on what I could do to make my life better.
I also concluded that I was being realistic to focus on improvement rather than recovery. In reading about CFIDS and getting to know other patients, I decided that possibly as few as 5% of patients recovered. To avoid likely disappointment, I decided to assume I was part of the 95% who didn't and to focus on finding ways to lead a meaningful life even if I didn't recover.
I found inspiration in the words of Dean Anderson, a CFIDS patient whose recovery story is in the Success Stories area on this site. He described how he combined acceptance of being ill with hope for a better life, defining acceptance not as resignation, but rather "an acceptance of the reality of the illness and of the need to lead a different kind of life, perhaps for the rest of my life."
I adopted his formulation as my own approach to CFIDS, saying "accepting that I am ill is what I have to do for now."
**Acknowledging Limits: The Energy Envelope**
Living with CFIDS was very frustrating. The illness imposed tight and seemingly inflexible limits, punishing me disproportionately for any infractions. I could walk for 15 minutes most days without intensifying symptoms, but 25 minutes might send me to bed for an hour.
It helped to remember the distinction between acute and chronic illness. Acute or short-term illnesses are temporary problems, conditions in which the diagnosis and treatment are clear and the outcome is usually predictable and positive. Such illnesses can be cured by medical help or are self-limiting.
Chronic illness is different. Instead of interrupting life briefly, it imposes long-term limits and forces patients to adjust their lives to it. Because of limits and uncertainty about final outcome, there is often a high level of frustration and a sense of helplessness.
Like many other patients, I learned that using an "acute illness" approach to symptoms didn't work. If I tried to ignore my body and just "push through," my symptoms were intensified greatly.
I finally decided that I would have to live my life according to rules dictated by the illness. I believed that my best chance for improvement lay in finding and honoring my limits. I hoped that by reducing stress on my body that it could find a way to improve.
I felt encouraged in this approach when I encountered the idea of the Energy Envelope in an article in the CFIDS Chronicle: "Think Inside the Envelope" (Fall, 1997). The article suggested that CFIDS patients have limited energy, but that they can gain some control over symptoms by keeping the energy they expend within the limits of their available energy. The authors called this "living inside the energy envelope."
For some time, I used this idea in a general way and found it very helpful. I would ask myself whether doing something would take me "outside the envelope" or whether I was living "inside the envelope." Thinking of the envelope reminded me of my limits and of my ability to control my symptoms to some degree by honoring my limits.
After a while, however, I thought the concept would be even more helpful if I could understand my limits in more detail and if I could understand how other factors like stress affected me.
So I began to ask myself a series of questions: how much sleep do I need at night? how much daytime rest? how much time can I spend safely on the computer? how long can I stand at one time without intensifying my symptoms? how far can I walk?
Thinking of my Energy Envelope in terms of different aspects of my life led to a detailed understanding of my limits. I ended up with a list of about fifteen items. (See [Finding Your Energy Envelope, Part II](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/library/finding-your-energy-envelope-part-2), an article on the self-help program website.)
In addition to those just mentioned, I included activity limits (how long I could do various activities like driving, standing, housework, reading, and spending time with people), stressors in my life, food sensitivities, sensitivity to light and noise, and emotions.
It took me at least a year to develop this more detailed understanding, but I felt rewarded all along the way because every insight I had helped me gain more control.
**Trying Experiments as a "CFIDS Scientist"**
I came to view living with CFIDS as a series of experiments that I called being my own "CFIDS scientist." Initially I didn't know my limits or understand what would help, so I decided to experiment. I assumed that some things might work but that others wouldn't. I tried to have a willingness to learn from my experience, especially when it contradicted my previous ideas.
**Experimenting with Exercise**
I learned a lot through my experiments, especially my attempts to exercise. Early on I was able to do only a fraction of what I could before becoming ill, walking fifteen minutes to half an hour most days. Through experimenting with walking at different times of day, I discovered that exercising in the afternoon was much less likely to lead to higher symptoms.
The realization led to a general realization that when I did something could be as important as how much. When I tried extending my walks, I observed that I sometimes felt fine during the walk but experienced strong symptoms afterwards or had to take a nap later in the day. That experience helped me to realize that the effects of activity might be delayed.
I was finally able to expand my exercise in a significant way when I incorporated scheduled rests into my walks. I would walk for 20 minutes, then sit down for a similar time, then walk some more. Planned rests also enabled me to begin walking again in areas with uphill stretches.
My progress was very slow. Often I extended the length of my walks by only one or two minutes every several weeks. Also, I backed off and I returned to my previous length if I experienced increased symptoms. But the discipline and patience paid off over time.
By extending my exercise very gradually as I could tolerate it, I have returned now to a level of exercise equivalent to what I had before becoming ill. On a July 2002 trip to Yosemite, I hiked almost 90 miles in six days, walking at a speed comparable to that on similar trips when I was 10 to 15 years younger.
**Keeping Records**
Keeping records was crucial to being a CFIDS scientist. I began my experiments with confidence that having systematic notes about my life would enable me to see patterns and to identify links between my actions and my symptoms. I experimented with a variety of logs, most requiring only a few minutes a day to fill out.
Record keeping enabled me to recognize fluctuations in symptoms by showing me that my CFIDS was worse in the morning and better in the evening, and that the effects of exertion were cumulative during a week. Also, logging showed me the connection between standing and symptoms, documented how much exercise was safe, and showed me my vulnerability to stress.
Logging was also a good motivating tool. After noticing that some days were better than others, I focused on trying to find what I was doing that created good days so I could expand them. I also used my records to chart my progress over time. At the end of each month, I rated myself using the CFS & Fibromyalgia Rating Scale. Seeing written evidence of improvement gave me hope.
**Controlling Relapses**
I assumed that I could explain any setback I experienced by studying my records, that all my relapses had causes I could identify. While this proved to be a high standard, it led to many helpful discoveries. By avoiding those things that created relapses, I was able to smooth out my life considerably, reducing both the frequency and severity of relapses, and eventually eliminating them.
I followed a three-step process to gain control over my relapses. At the end of 1998 I reviewed my logs for that year to identify all my relapses. (I defined a relapse as symptoms so severe that I had to spend at least one full day in bed.) I found eight. Then I looked for common causes and discovered that almost all the relapses were associated with either having another illness or travel.
Last, I formulated a strategy to minimize the impact of each of these factors. To combat relapses triggered by secondary illnesses, I decided to take extra rest even after the symptoms of the secondary illness had ended.
To minimize travel-related setbacks, I limited travel to a few hours' driving distance from home and included a ten-minute rest for each two hours driven. The total time to complete the three steps was about two hours. I haven't had a relapse since.
In the next article (see: Recovery from CFIDS: What Worked for Me, Part 2), I'll discuss the other strategies I found helpful. |

# Recovery from CFIDS: What Worked for Me, Part 2 | Treating CFS & FM

|
*(Note: Second of two articles. Read part 1 **here**. The two parts are an expanded version of an article published in the CFIDS Chronicle as a two-part series in Spring and Summer 2002.) *
When I became ill with CFIDS in 1997, I functioned at about 25% of my pre-illness level. Five years later, I consider myself recovered.
I no longer experience symptoms of CFIDS and have an activity level comparable to that of other people of my age. I have even been able to return to hiking. On a recent trip to Yosemite, I hiked almost 90 miles in six days, at a speed comparable to my pace when I was 10 to 15 years younger.
My improvement has been gradual but steady, averaging one or two percent a month. I followed exclusively a self-help approach in my efforts to improve. In the first part of this article I described four elements of my self-management program. I discuss three more in this part.
**1) Having Faith **
I believe that faith was an important part of my improvement. By that I am not referring to something religious, but rather to a belief that my body had an innate drive to reestablish good health.
I thought I had two roles in support of my body: 1) to discover what conditions best supported my body's recuperative powers, and 2) to live consistently in a way that allowed these powers to be expressed.
I call this faith because I had to proceed with little or no reinforcement that I was doing the right thing. My progress was very slow and there were periods of several months when it was hard to see any improvement.
**Pacing **
I came to believe that creating stability was one of the most helpful things I could do for my body. This idea developed in response to the frustration I experienced in my first several months with CFIDS, when my life was on a roller coaster.
I rested when my symptoms were intense, then was overactive when the symptoms declined. Doing too much led to high symptoms again and the demoralizing cycle started over. I was living in response to my symptoms, which left me feeling my life was out of control.
The idea of pacing offered an alternative. Pacing meant finding the right balance of activity and rest, and applying that balance on an everyday basis.
The key was to live a life that was planned, with a similar amount of activity and rest every day. Having a consistent level of activity made sense, but I resisted the idea of scheduling rest every day.
It was hard to accept the idea that I would lie down voluntarily regardless of how I felt. I decided to try it by having a fifteen minute rest every afternoon. Much to my surprise, the rest helped, reducing my symptoms and making my life more stable. After a while I added a morning rest as well. I also experimented with how I structured my rests, finally defining rest as "lying down in a quiet place with my eyes closed."
I found that taking these "pre-emptive rests," as a friend called them, enabled me to reduce the time I spent in "recuperative rest" or resting in response to symptoms. The result was that my total rest time was reduced. Looking back, I think the two daily rests were the most important thing I did to aid my recovery.
Resting on a planned schedule greatly stabilized my life, enabling me to get off the roller coaster and giving me a much greater sense of control. Seeing that there was something I could do that gave me some control boosted my confidence that I could bring the illness as a whole under control.
**Building on the Positive**
My daily record keeping ended with an overall rating for the day. My scale went from +2 if it was a very good day to -2 for a very bad one. It gave me hope to see that not all days were the same, that some were better than others.
Having good days also was very motivating. I asked myself: what am I doing differently on those days and how can I do more of it? This was another way in which I reinforced for myself a belief that I could gain control over the illness. It also deepened my conviction that I could find things that improved my quality of life.
**Controlling Stress**
Early on I discovered that CFIDS made me very stress-sensitive. Any kind of conflict set off my symptoms and often things as simple as making decisions felt overwhelming. Even modest amounts of stress greatly intensified my symptoms, creating a feedback loop in which my symptoms and my response to them intensified one another.
Once I realized how vulnerable to stress I had become, I decided that dealing with stress sensitivity had to be a big part of my effort to manage CFIDS.
My first reaction was to try various strategies for stress reduction. The most helpful proved to be a regular relaxation/meditation practice, which I included in my daily rests. Relaxing my mind while relaxing my body had a dramatic effect on my anxiety level, thus reducing my tendency to over-produce adrenalin.
Stress avoidance proved to be even more helpful. I learned that I could prevent stress by avoiding those things that caused it. The most useful strategy in that regard was routine: living my life as much as I could according to a plan.
Having a daily schedule of activity, rest, exercise and socializing at set times gave structure and predictability to my life. With routine I had less pressure, and fewer surprises and emotional shocks.
I also learned to identify stress triggers, those situations and even specific people that set off symptoms. I learned, for example, that I was vulnerable to sensory overload after observing how noisy situations quickly led to intense symptoms. I also observed that situations of conflict were much more stressful than before. I then tried to avoid or minimize these stress triggers.
**Managing Emotions**
I knew from my work at Stanford that strong emotions are normal reactions to having a chronic illness. Serious illness turns people's lives upside down, upsetting their hopes and goals, and creating frustration and uncertainty. So I knew intellectually that managing emotions could be just as challenging as managing the physical aspects of the illness.
I don't think this background prepared me, however, for the strength of the feelings associated with CFIDS and their apparent connection with the physiology of the illness. I felt less in control of my emotions than at almost any time in my life.
I developed a number of strategies in response, all based on recognition that I was much more emotionally vulnerable than usual. First, I observed that the strength of my emotions was often associated with the strength of my physical symptoms, and that the strategies used to control symptoms also helped moderate my emotions. In particular, resting seemed to reduce the intensity of emotions as well as alleviating my fatigue and brain fog.
Second, I observed that I had an exaggerated initial reaction to relapses, often seeing them as evidence I would never improve. So I learned to talk in reassuring tones to myself. I consoled myself by saying things like "you've always bounced back from other setbacks" or "remember how life looks better after you've rested."
Third, I trained myself to mute my emotions after observing the toll that strong emotions took on me, whether positive or negative. It seemed that experiences that triggered the release of adrenalin led to an increase in symptoms. As a way to avoid symptoms, I tried to cultivate calmness and to construct a life that emphasized routine.
**2) Creating New Meaning in Response to Loss **
My work at Stanford had convinced me that chronic illness was inherently depressing. What other reaction would you expect if a normal life was replaced with one that involved large amounts of suffering and great uncertainty about the future?
But an even bigger challenge was coming to terms with loss. Having CFIDS stripped away most of what I viewed as myself. Because of CFIDS, I gave up work and volunteer commitments, let most relationships slide, lost my ability to be physically active, and replaced an optimistic view of my future with uncertainty.
I did two things to cope with loss. The first was to publicly acknowledge the loss. In a Christmas letter sent a year and a half after getting CFIDS, I wrote to friends that I had been living with a disease for which there was no standard treatment or cure.
And I concluded: "I am sobered by the realization that it is highly unlikely that I will return to the level of functioning that I had before becoming ill and so probably will have to adjust to living a life with greater limits than before."
Even though I wrote to alert others to expect less of me in the future, I think the more profound effects were on me. Even though my prediction turned out to be wrong, the public declaration helped me recognize the extent of my loss and the possibility that it was permanent.
My other response to loss was to create new relationships and new meaning in my life. Within weeks of receiving my diagnosis, I joined two local support groups.
The experience was especially useful for the friends I made. I found there is something powerfully healing about feeling understood, all the more so for a stigmatized disease that some don't believe is real.
Illness is isolating; feeling connected to others gave me a sense of belonging. Also, fellow patients were tremendous sources of information and perspective, helping me to understand CFIDS much more quickly than I could have on my own.
Because I stopped working and dropped out of my volunteer commitments shortly after becoming ill, fellow patients became perhaps my most important community. I think that served me well. I took CFIDS patients to be my peers, not healthy people. That meant that I measured myself in comparison to them, not to my peers from work or healthy friends. That comparison took a lot of pressure off.
A few months after receiving my diagnosis, I started a self-help class for myself and other patients I had met. Over time it has become the CFIDS/Fibromyalgia Self-Help program.
Developing the program enabled me to find new meaning in response to the losses I had experienced due to the illness. By developing new goals and focusing on what I was still able to do, I found a way to feel useful even when previous roles had fallen away.
**3) Living a Disciplined Life**
The final factor in my recovery strategy was discipline. By this I mean learning to live consistently within my energy envelope and extending my activity level gradually as permitted by the illness.
Just as an alcoholic must learn to abstain from alcohol and a person controlling his weight must learn to live in a different way, I assumed that my ability to improve depended on my changing my habits so that I lived consistently in a way conducive to recovery.
This approach was summarized in an article in the CFIDS Chronicle by JoWynn Johns, a member of our first Internet class: "Support for Changing Our Lifestyle." JoWynn wrote:
*[The] Self-Help Course provides the information and the structure needed to facilitate changing one's habits and routines---something that is hard for all of us. Not a prescription for what to do, the course is a process of discovering for ourselves what we uniquely need to change in our lifestyle. *
Just as Weight Watchers and Alcoholics Anonymous provide the information and structure people need to change their eating and drinking habits, this course provides what PWCs [people with CFIDS] need to change our daily routines and find a way of living that helps to reduce symptoms and that, in some cases, has led to significant recovery.
Dean Anderson says much the same thing in the account of his recovery, also published in the CFIDS Chronicle. He believes that the key to his recovery was a certain kind of acceptance, different from resignation. It was "acceptance of the reality of illness and of the need to lead a different kind of life, perhaps for the rest of my life."
He went on to say that "the ‘effort' required to recover from CFIDS is an exercise in discipline and hopefulness." The discipline he believes is needed is the opposite of the discipline of striving. It is the discipline "to recognize and adhere to one's known limitations and to follow a strict regimen without periodically lapsing."
For me, learning to live consistently within my Energy Envelope required that I first find my limits, as described in section 3, and then honor them. I developed a number of strategies to help me stay inside my envelope and to handle "lapses."
Perhaps the most useful was to visualize how I would feel if I went outside my envelope. Imagining the fatigue and brain fog provided a counterweight to the immediate pleasure I anticipate from doing something that took me beyond my limit.
Record-keeping also helped me live within my limits. Having written proof of the effects of my actions helped me to hold myself accountable for my actions. Records were a graphic and irrefutable way to prove to myself what doing too much did to me in terms of symptoms and the need for extra rest. Also, I used my health log as a positive motivator, helping me aim for more frequent no-symptom days.
A third strategy was the use of routine. Having a regular schedule enabled me to avoid a lot of decision making. Instead of having to ask whether something was or was not within my envelope, I tried to stick to a schedule I knew was safe.
A related idea is what I call having rules for specific situations. For example, during one period I found I could drive without intensifying symptoms if I took a 10-minute break every two hours.
Finally, I tried to be forgiving with myself. I didn't always stay in my envelope. But, instead of beating myself up for failing, I decided it was better to just to say "what can I learn from this experience" and move on.
This approach required a great deal of patience. As noted in the section on faith, I needed to feel confident that my approach would pay off in the long run. Although it was very difficult at times, I resisted the temptation to hope for a quick recovery and I took consolation in my steady progress, even if it was at a pace of one or two percent a month.
**Summary**
I began my journey of self-healing with an acceptance that my life had changed, perhaps forever and certainly for an extended period. I believed that to get better I would have to accept responsibility for finding things that would help me.
I acknowledged that CFIDS imposed severe limits, and decided that living a disciplined life consistent with those limits offered the best chance of controlling symptoms and improving my quality of life. Finally, I had confidence that I could find things that would help me get better and committed myself to experimenting to find what worked.
My approach of using self-help exclusively was different from that taken by most patients. Under different circumstances, I might have combined a self-management approach with a medical one.
But self-help served me well, enabling me to regain my health gradually over a period of four years, using techniques I believed were safe and prudent, focusing as they did on living within limits and extending those limits very gradually as allowed by the illness.
Your illness may be more or less severe than mine. Your life circumstances are likely to be different in one or more ways. You may decide that medications and other treatments can be helpful to you. But I hope you will also explore what you can do to help yourself. |

# Step by Step Improvement | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Editor's Note: This article is reprinted from the Winter 2009 issue of the CFIDS Chronicle. Dianne has a PhD in sociology and was working at UCLA when she become ill in 1985.*
On December 26, 2007, I walked to the bathroom for the first time since 1988. My battle with CFS began in 1984 with a five-week respiratory infection that my roommate and I had simultaneously. After we recovered from that sickness, my roommate stayed well. In January 1985, I got sick again and never got better. Two months later I was unable to work.
Until 1988 I could walk, drive and fix one or two meals, but then I became extremely ill. For the next four years I lay on my back 24 hours a day, getting up only to use the bed- side commode. I couldn’t talk above a whisper.
Conversations of more than a few sentences caused a relapse. I couldn’t read, write, walk, listen to the radio, watch TV or sleep on my side or stomach. Being moved by wheelchair from my room every two weeks so the room could be cleaned caused a relapse lasting about a week.
In 1992 the deterioration I’d felt since the beginning of my illness finally ebbed. On a “good day” I could do a little more and get away with it. But the gains were gradual, and I seemed unable to strengthen my legs. Still, independence was my goal, and I wanted to walk.
I thought I knew how to proceed because I’d already gained some strength for eating by using a gradual approach. Since 1988 I’d eaten only mashed food. Then one day a whole pea appeared in my food, and I ate it without relapse. Within three months I ate almost entirely whole food.
Now I sought the “one pea” equivalent for walking. I tried taking three steps by my bed but the relapse was severe and prolonged. Could I lean my hands on the bed and take one step sideways with one foot?
Yes, but at a price. I waited for the perfect time to try again—it seldom came, and I realized this was not the way to progress to walking. Physical therapy didn’t seem to help, and for eight years I tried various exercises and strategies. Nothing worked.
Now I see my mistake: thinking that exercise had to be significant and result in a marked gain in strength. Instead, anything moderate backfired, making me sicker and weaker. So I sought an effective exercise that was just consistently doable. Maybe I’d never walk but at least I’d be headed in that direction without dread or exercise-induced relapses.
I began this strategy with two new guidelines:
1. Find an exercise small enough that I can come out of a relapse while doing it. With something at that level, if I was experiencing a relapse I could continue the exercise because I’d know the relapse wasn’t caused by it.
2. Increase the exercise or begin a new one only when my body lets me know that it’s all right. Don’t get caught up in predetermined schedules of progression.
Then as months and years passed, I expanded on the original two guidelines:
3. Make notes, and carefully describe exercises. Measure and record increases in time or frequency. This allowed me to track expended energy more accurately and avoid doing too much. Also, I could learn the rhythm of my relapses. When do they start relative to overexertion? What are their early warning signs, length and signs of improvement?
The answers to these questions changed as I got stronger, so tracking my condition helped me reevaluate. Further, memory lapses were lessened if I kept careful records.
I could isolate the effects of exercises on symptoms by documenting any- thing relevant to the illness (a visitor, a trip out of the house or exposure to toxins). I discovered that keeping records encouraged me when progress was slow. I could look back and see I really had gained in strength.
4. Work on increasing repetitions of the exercise before increasing the load. (I read this advice in the CFIDS Chronicle.)
5. Try a new exercise only when reasonably sure the social and physical environment will be stable for a few days.
6. Do a new exercise in the morning. As its repetitions increase, spread them throughout the day. Do the exercise at night only when it has become easy to do during the day. This rule minimized the impact of a new exercise on my fragile sleep.
7. If an exercise is too strenuous, break it down into its component parts and attempt one part at a time. If I can’t do any parts, try the next closest thing.
8. When possible, choose exercises that can accompany some activity I must do. I began this new program in early 2001 by, once a day, sliding one knee to my chest while sitting in bed, and lifting one knee to my chest while sitting on the bedside commode, and stretching my feet. After two-and-a- half years I did each activity six times a day. Over the next two years I added isometric leg exercises and arm and trunk strengthening work.
In late 2005 I began standing while leaning on the bed. After nine months of this activity I was standing for three minutes, eight times a day. I unsuccessfully attempted the sideways step I’d tried in the 1990s. But after a few more months I was taking two of these side steps eight times a day, still leaning on the bed.
Then I started standing unsupported, and four months later I could stand for three minutes eight times a day. I progressively put more weight on one leg and then the other. After almost three months I could stand on each leg for three seconds eight times a day.
Now I was ready to walk. I began trying in late May 2007. By June 1, 2007, I consistently walked two steps a day. I took off: The steps taken on the first of the next few months, respectively, were 6, 21, 48, 101, 185, 301!
I’m still sick. All the old symptoms lie in wait. I still take all my old medications plus a few new ones. Exposures to chemicals or allergens can stop my progress. I still spend most of my time lying in bed with my eyes closed and the radio off.
But regardless of the circumstances, I don’t stop exercising. Knowing I have done the exercises during a relapse tells me I can safely do them even when I feel terrible.
However, my life has changed enormously. More activity is required to elicit a relapse. Recovery time is shorter. I can do more for myself and, although I may never vacuum the house or climb a mountain, relative independence (with the help of a motorized scooter) now seems possible.
Exercises alone don’t account for my progress. In addition to the medications, I needed quiet, freedom from allergens and toxins, help doing things I couldn’t do for myself.
I also needed the ability to set my own activity level and to say, “This helps,” or “That hurts.” For those who gave me the accommodations, help and trust I needed—my family, boyfriend, nurse, doctor, caregivers and friends—this is their victory too.
Now on to the kitchen.
**Afterword**
I've passed many milestones since walking to the bathroom that day: walking to the kitchen; cooking all my food; doing the laundry; giving up the use of a scooter; getting my driver’s license; taking daily walks in the neighborhood; and driving myself to and from medical appointments and grocery stores.
Medications and rest are still essential parts of my life and will probably remain so. A rash restricts my diet, and I still have chemical sensitivities. But there is no sign that the improvement is ceasing. With the exception of heavy housework and gardening, the dream I had in the 1990s is now a reality. I’m independent.

# Self-Sabotage and Getting Back on Track  | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Kathy is a CFS patient from Texas and a moderator in the CFIDS & Fibomyalgia Self-Help Program. She wrote the following as part of a discussion on the questions “**What are the ways you sabotage yourself?” and “how do you get back on track?”*
Over time, I’ve become aware of several different ways I make my symptoms worse, but I’ve also learned strategies for avoiding some relapses and getting myself back on track in other cases.
One way I sabotage myself is simply doing too much, going outside my Energy Envelope. This can happen when I carefully do each little thing in my day, with a short rest between activities, but in total it adds up to too much.
Over time, I discovered that if I am paying attention to how I feel, I can observe that the little tasks become harder and harder. If I can catch myself before I am exhausted and call it a day, I can usually avoid a relapse.
Another way I sabotage myself is when I talk while walking or walk too fast, or hurry to do anything at all. All these things quickly push me beyond my energy limit. So if I get a phone call, I immediately sit down to talk.
My walking energy envelope is tiny, measured in steps, not minutes, and going over that limit causes Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM) rather easily. [Note: PEM is the intensification of symptoms triggered by overdoing.] I don't avoid walking, but I am very careful to go slow and stop often, and I monitor my heart rate.
Adrenaline is also my evil companion. I can sabotage myself by getting exuberant about anything. Before CFS, I found showering very refreshing and exhilarating. I would come out of the shower with more energy than when I went in.
Now showering is one of the hardest things in my day. I have to constantly remind myself to stay calm in all situations. When I am having fun with friends, it's especially hard to stay calm, because I tend to forget the consequences of acting normal.
Of course stress is very harmful, and adrenaline rushing stress is even worse, like the time my Dad passed out, and they called and told me had had a stroke. He hadn't - he was just dehydrated from drinking too much coffee and little else. My heart rate immediately climbed to 135 from a huge adrenaline rush and it stayed abnormally high all day.
**Getting Back on Track**
I often cannot tell how I feel until I have been up for an hour or so. Sometime when I think I feel really good my resting heart rate is a bit elevated (like 3 points higher than average). I can quickly tell then that I am adrenaline mode and my heart rate goes up too much with any activity.
As a friend says, “Feeling good is dangerous.” This adrenaline mode is kind of a pre-crash state, but if I spot it and respond by resting, it is my opportunity to avoid a crash.
**Conclusion**
It has not been easy for me to learn how to stay within my energy envelope, and I can still sabotage myself if I exceed my limits. Any time I do too much, even in small chunks, I can go over my energy envelope. Other things that cause me to go outside my limit are stress, rushing around or doing anything fast, and getting excited or exuberant.
But I have discovered that the sooner I recognize the signs of overexertion, the smaller are the consequences. The earliest sign, and the one I find most useful, is my heart rate (resting and while active).
If I wait until I am tired, then it might be too late to avoid PEM entirely. If I ignore my fatigue and keep going, it may take many days, even weeks, to get my body back to its ’normal’. The longer I ignore my symptoms, the longer it takes me to recover. Conversely, the sooner I get back on track, the better!

# Climbing Back from Severe CFS | Treating CFS & FM

*Note: Pris has been a member of the self-help program community since 2012. For samples of the writing she describes in the article, see her website, *[Poetic Inspirations](http://www.poeticinspire.com/).
I woke up one day in 1990 with a severe case of what was later to be diagnosed as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. This is the story of how I slowly climbed out of the deep hole I fell into and also how I found a new identity through writing.
**How CFS/ME Changed My Life**
My health had been good up to the day I got sick. I had a career as a clinical psychologist. In terms of physical activity, I swam and sailed, and biked daily.
All that changed suddenly the day in 1990 when I woke up very sick. I couldn’t keep my balance when I got out of bed and keeled over. I shook violently inside as if a vice was tightening around my head, made intolerably worse when exposed to light or sound.
My muscles would become rigid and my eyes jerked back and forth. I had periodic tugging sensations in my head that would pull me into coma-like sleeps, after which all of my symptoms were even worse.
The world was constantly blurred, as if I was at the bottom of a swimming pool, and I was unable to remember names of things or complete sentences correctly. I threw up every day for the first year, was limp with fatigue and had very bad pain.
I received a diagnosis of CFS the next year, and I was later diagnosed as also having fibromyalgia, hypothyroidism, chemical sensitivities, and interstitial cystitis.
During the early years, I often couldn’t talk at all and when I could, it brought on excruciating pain. For over six years, I wrote notes or faxed people since I was unable to use the computer.
Eventually, this problem was diagnosed as muscle dysphonia, in which fibromyalgia based spasms in my neck radiated up to my voice box, keeping it in a constant spasm. Allergies and tightening my throat against the pain were also factors.
I survived by pretending I was a POW, hoping that I would receive some sort of reprieve some day. It came in the form of a referral to an immunologist in 1999. Before then, I got no medical help, in spite of spending lots of money on ineffective 'miracle cures'.
Besides giving me good feedback about diet and supplements to help my immune system, he offered clonazepam (Klonopin), which slowed down my over-activated nervous system.
After taking it for three weeks, I could tolerate light and sound again and the eye/muscle jerking and head vice sensations stopped. For the first time I could sign onto a computer, watch an hour of TV a day, and have friends over in limited doses.
Later, I was accepted as a patient at the Klimas Center, where supplements have raised my NK cells from almost nothing to normal in number and into the 13th percentile in activity. This stopped my leapfrogging from one virus to another. I also first learned about pacing there, which I understood meant avoiding push and crash by finding a level of activity that didn’t make me worse.
**My Adaptations & Improvement**
I started pacing on my own by logging. I filled in sheet after sheet of my daily activities, but I had no real sense of what to do with this information. If I saw I was doing a lot of something I tried to cut back but had no idea how to judge by how much.
It wasn't until I joined this program’s online courses that I started to pace myself properly by using the data to set limits on the things I did and sticking to an agenda. With those changes, both my clarity and energy began to improve. The dizziness decreased over time until it’s only rarely a problem now.
With the help of the lesson plans, logging, and experimenting with short-term goals, I gradually discovered the maximum amount of time I could spend doing different things before brain fog, pain, and fatigue intensified. For example, I can watch one TV movie early in the day without increasing any symptoms. If I watch two, I feel foggy and more fatigued the next day.
I became religious about my flat rests with eyes closed and an afternoon nap. Previously, I had thought I was being lazy and not trying hard enough, if I succumbed to sleeping. Now I see that if I miss the nap one day, I have brain fog, concentration problems and more fatigue the next day.
I also do simple exercises and stretches daily, some lying flat and others sitting. By strengthening my muscles, my pain has decreased significantly. I practice mindfulness by focusing on my breath and on the here and now, while reminding myself that it does no good to worry about bad things that might happen.
The pacing groups in this program have been invaluable in helping me find my energy envelope (my limits) and teaching me to live within it, as well as providing me with a community of other people whose goal is to treat themselves with care and kindness.
In spite of these increases I still am essentially housebound, since I can’t drive without getting confused quickly. I also get disoriented and fatigued in places that are high in stimulation, such as grocery stores, restaurants and social gatherings.
I am very grateful, however, to have improved enough to lead a satisfying, though quiet, life. I enjoy a ride over to the ocean, a meal picked up and eaten outside. I can go into a small quiet store for a short time. Doctor’s offices or the dentist no longer send me reeling with dizziness.
**Writing & A New Identity**
A new identity has gradually grown out of this illness, one which brings me much joy since it’s rooted in writing. I always wanted to write, had written two plays in sixth grade and started a detective story in 9th grade. Even though I went into psychology, I never lost my longing to be a writer.
When I had improved enough to use the computer again, I stumbled across a “write a haiku a day” site. I didn't have a clue what I was doing but writing daily gave me a taste of the creative life again at a pace I could sustain. It became a life line since it brought me back to a taste of the life I once wanted.
I next stumbled across a poetry board, learned about free verse and a bit more about haiku. I was still a beginner, but I was having fun. I had found something that allowed my soul to speak again.
I was lucky to meet other writers I liked who saw something good in my writing, and offered me encouragement and suggestions. I was like a starving person being offered a feast. I loved learning again, this time in short forms I could manage with my cognitive limitations.
Over time I got better, received recognition from my peers, and was published in journals and even published seven books.
In so many ways this was a journey back to the beginning, to the aspiration I had when 11 years old. I had finally realized the dream of being a writer.
I’m grateful for my improvement. I treat it as a gift.

# The Many Reasons Why I Improved | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Many people believe that improvement is difficult when a case of CFS or FM is severe. The experience of Bobbie Brown, a CFS & FM patient from Arizona, offers evidence that patients can get better. *
Bobbie has taken the CFIDS & Fibromyalgia Self-Help Program's course and participated in its support groups. She reports that she has improved from 10%-20% of normal to 35%-40%.
**Bobbie's List: Reasons Why I've Improved**
When asked to explain what she has done to improve, she listed the following:
- I started taking a supplement called Dr. Shulze's Super Food*
- Pre-emptive rest (I rest a lot)
- Fruit & yogurt smoothie everyday (plain yogurt, frozen fruit-smoothie blend fruit and frozen blueberries with fresh strawberries and bananas) then I put the Super Food in it
- A great chiropractor
- Do my stretching and exercises in the pool/have a Jacuzzi tub for pain
- Don't drive myself more than 10 miles from home/don't drive at all on bad days
- Use pain killers only as needed
- I take Celexa for depression/nerves
- I bought the self-help course textbook and joined the classes and support groups
- I found a great church and volunteer 1 1/2 hours a week and teach Sunday School!
- Our children and families moved near us after we moved here for my health (grandkids make me very happy)
- Cut down on computer time
- Cut down on phone time
- NO STRESS: I trained friends and relatives to bring no stress through our front door
- Stay away from situations that have too much input
- Don't try to be the head of the family and plan events
- Don't have dinner parties for more than a couple of people at a time/then order out
- Don't stay too long at others parties
- We only take trips that are within 6 hours of where we live and can drive
- Stay home a lot and watch good movies on bad days
- Stay positive and joke about my special problems
- I got an electric scooter so I don't have to restrict my outings so much (baseball games, mall)
- My husband does all the shopping, most of the laundry, most of the cooking, vacuuming, etc
- I do not work anymore
- I have not had sleep interruptions for several months! Makes a big difference!
**Comments**
A long list of coping strategies is consistent with the experience of other people in our program. There is rarely a single, magic bullet for people with CFS and FM. Rather, most patients find they are helped by using a variety of approaches, often including both medications and self-management techniques.
Two items in Bobbie's list refer to medications. She also reports using non-drug treatments for pain. Most of her strategies, however, involve changes in her daily habits and routines.
She uses pacing techniques such as taking regular, scheduled rests and living within limits. In fact, almost half her items are techniques for setting limits on herself, including limits on:
- Driving
- Computer and phone time
- Stress and sensory input
- Socializing
- Travel and time outside the house
- Household and family responsibilities
Other factors she mentions include good nutrition, exercise, support, helping others and good sleep. In addition to these regular practices, Bobbie and her husband have also made two larger lifestyle changes. Bobbie is no longer working and they moved from Nevada to Arizona to improve her health.
Bobbie's experience is a good example of a patient taking responsibility for her health by combining the use of resources from the medical system with lifestyle changes.
*Note on item 1: Bobbie's use of this supplement does not imply an endorsement from the CFIDS & FM Self-Help program. While people in our program use a variety of medications, supplements and other treatments, the program does not recommend any specific products.

# Finding and Staying Within My Limits | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note; Pacing has three parts:* *1) finding your limits, 2) adapting to your limits, and 3) expanding your limits. In the article below, Kathy Mero explains the different strategies she has used for parts 1 and 2. Kathy is a CFS patient from Texas and a moderator in the CFIDS and FM Self-Help Program.*
Finding my limits has been a real challenge! I haven't found them all yet, but I am making progress and monitoring my heart rate has been a big help. [Note: An elevated heart rate triggers an intensification of symptoms. See the article [Pacing By Numbers: Using Your Heart Rate to Stay Inside the Energy Envelope](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/library/pacing-numbers-using-your-heart-rate-to-stay-inside-energy-envelope) on the self-help program website for instructions on how to find your heart rate threshold.]
The first monitor I used showed me when my heart rate was over my threshold, so I knew when I needed to stop. This prevented many crashes. And I learned how it feels when my heart rate is too high, which was very useful for times when I was not wearing the monitor.
Since I got a FitBit, which I wear all day and all night, I have been able to go way beyond just monitoring my heart rate. Now I track it, graph it, and analyze it every day. As nutty as this sounds, it's kind of fun, and takes only about 5 minutes every day.
I find knowing my resting heart rate [explained in article mentioned above], which I calculate every day, to be very useful. When my resting heart rate goes up by 2 or 3 points above normal, I label the graph with what I did that caused it.
Usually, after a big overdoing, my resting heart rate goes up by a few points each day for 3 days, then it slowly comes down, one point every day or two. It takes a lot longer to come back down than it does to go up. By watching my resting heart rate, I can rest a lot before the worst crash day, and avoid a really bad relapse.
**Logging, Experimentation and Rules**
Along with all this tracking and graphing, I log the big items for the day. This gives me the information I need to figure out where I went wrong! So logging is another strategy I use to find my limits.
Experimentation is another way I find my limits and, once I know them, I translate the limits into rules which cover both everyday life and special events. My biggest potential for overdoing is when I visit my folks. I have some basic rules, such as afternoon appointments only, no big shopping trips, no cafeteria style lunches where I have to stand in line.
And, I need to leave their house before the afternoon commute traffic picks up. It's a 6 hour day for me, so I need for it to be as easy as possible. My internal rules are to remain calm, breathe deeply, and sit in the car while Dad runs his errands.
Through trial and error, I’ve found that my tiniest energy envelope is physical activity, walking in particular. It is about 90 steps to my parent's apartment from the elevator. My heart rate increases before 90 steps, even when I walk slowly. Enlarging this envelope would greatly reduce Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM) for me. [Note: PEM is the intensification of symptoms caused by overdoing.]
I crashed once after going to a movie. It was because the walk between the parking lot and the theatre was more than 150 steps, and we walked too quickly.
Knowing that 150 steps without a rest pushes me into PEM, the next time we went to the theater I stopped a couple of times along the way, looking at the movie posters, and walked more slowly. That was all I needed to make the ‘trip’ without harming myself.
I used my heart rate to figure out most of my little limits, except for the mental limits. I can tell when my brain is tired, because I can no longer think straight. I rarely get physical symptoms of PEM from mental exertion, but I think I get ‘brain PEM’, or brain fog, for a couple of days after overdoing.
Some other causes of PEM surprise me. For example, through experimentation, I learned that my limit for doing paperwork, like filing and bill paying, is only 30 minutes, once per day.
**Conclusion**
Finding my limits has been an ongoing challenge, but well worth the effort because of the relapses I am able to avoid. The tools I have used to find my limits include heart rate monitoring, logging, experimentation, and observing my symptoms. Based on my limits, I am often able to establish rules, which are especially helpful for my more difficult tasks.
If I use my rules and honor my limits, I can usually stay relatively symptom-free. |

# How I Use Pacing to Get Out of Pain | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Nancy is a CFS patient from New York who joined the CFIDS & FM Self-Help Program in Fall, 2015. She wrote the message below a few months later to welcome a new member.*
Hi Mary and welcome to the group!
I am relatively new here myself; I’ve been in this group two months, after completing the introductory course in the fall.
I've had CFS for 7 years and was bedridden for a year. I spent years pushing and crashing, then began to learn pacing. I was stable for a year or so, but had to learn a whole new level of self-care and discipline when my mom came to live with me and I became her caretaker two years ago. My health dipped for more than a year, and I have been in pain daily most of that time.
What’s been so helpful about this program is that their techniques are more detailed and specific versions of what I had been doing to get better the first time. It's giving me a new, more committed mindset as well as a new set of tools to use minute by minute through the day.
I have learned more about the daily intricacies of pacing and conserving energy here than I was able to do on my own. And I've begun to experience pain-free days again -- through keeping track of activity every day, finding my limits and sticking to them more strictly, and also disciplining myself to rest more regularly and frequently.
I now have a chair in the kitchen, and sit down every few minutes while I'm cooking. I also recently used one of those motorized wheelchairs in the grocery store, which I never would have done before, but am so glad to be doing because I have learned that walking is much more tiring than I realized.
This group has also inspired me to get a pedometer and count daily steps as another way of keeping track of energy usage. All of which has led to a much-desired symptom reduction that I had not been able to achieve on my own.
I have also realized how much my mood and self-image has depended on my being energetic and fast-moving, and how little I wanted to accept actually being chronically ill. Being more accepting of myself, however, has not been depressing at all, but has been a real relief!
Without this group, I might still be in pain and not know how to use pacing to get me out of pain. And without the commitment of our group leader and her belief in my ability to live within my Energy Envelope, I might have simply given up and learned to live with the pain.
Happy and healthy new year to you and everyone in the group,
Nancy

# Using Pacing to Control Relapses & Reduce Symptoms | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Kathy is a CFS patient from Texas and a moderator in the CFIDS & Fibromyalgia Self-Help Program. She wrote this article in 2016.*
For many years, life with CFS meant living with frequent relapses. Then through the self-help program, I learned pacing strategies that have enabled me to eliminate crashes almost entirely and to live symptom-free most of the time.
**Life with CFS Before Pacing**
I have had CFS for 27 years. When I was first ill, but had not been diagnosed, I decided my fatigue could be improved through exercise. I started with 15 minutes of walking, which intensified my fatigue greatly. My first exercise program lasted three days and subsequent tries were equally unsuccessful.
After my CFS diagnosis a couple of years later, I quit pushing myself to exercise, but still experienced a milder form of push and crash. For many years, I lived with this milder form of push-crash. I hated having to push myself to do things, but I thought it was just part of the illness.
Even after I retired, I still suffered crashes. I rested whenever I felt tired, but didn’t understand what caused me to get so tired on some days, while feeling fine on others.
**My Pacing Strategies**
It wasn’t until I joined the self help program three years ago that I learned about pacing and setting limits. Using pacing, I have been able to minimize and almost eliminate crashes, and live mostly symptom-free.
Of the many pacing strategies the program describes, here are the ones that are most helpful to me.
**Delegating, Simplifying, and Eliminating **
I have delegated heavy housecleaning to my housekeeper, and heavy lifting of anything to my husband. I simplify as much as I can, which for me often translates to prioritizing.
For example, if I want to de-clutter or clean the kitchen, but don't have energy to do all of it, I do what makes the biggest difference and leave the rest till later. I always say, do the easy stuff first!
I have also simplified cooking, by limiting the amount of chopping and dicing for each meal. Oven baking is easier than stovetop frying. Sometimes I eliminate cooking by eating out! I have eliminated most physical activities, like mall shopping and walking distances.
**Taking Scheduled Rests **
I rest every day after my shower. Usually my rests are sitting on the couch with my feet propped up. If I feel like it, I lie down, but normally, sitting is quite restful for me. If I have spent the day out, I often take a flat rest when I get home.
**Putting Limits on Individual Activities**
I don't know my limits on all activities, but I know my limit for standing in the kitchen and cleaning or cooking is about an hour when I am at my best. Computer is time is much longer, unless it involves a lot of concentration. Bill paying and paper shuffling is limited to 30 minutes.
**Activity Switching**
I definitely use this one! When I get tired from thinking, I get up and do some laundry or light cleaning. If I am physically too tired, then I get sedentary and watch TV.
**Using Devices **
I rely on my heart rate monitor to help me figure out when I need to stop. It seems to me that when my adrenaline kicks in, my heart rate goes up and it's a good indication that I have used up all my energy for the time being.
If I stop at that time, I avoid the out of proportion increase in symptoms called Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM). If I stop before that happens, it's even better, because it gives me extra energy the next day, with less chance for adrenaline to kick in.
I also use my resting heart rate, described in another *article on this site, to determine what my energy envelope will be for the day. If it's even 3 points higher than normal, I know that adrenaline will raise my heart rate sooner than normal. So I reduce my activity level for the day.
**Rule of Substitution (Pigs at a Trough)**
I love this one! It helps me to plan my days, if I think in terms of having a limited number of things I can do in a day. This strategy allows me the freedom to pick and choose what I want to do each day. I can choose to do things I like to do, rather than only things I 'should' do.
If I want to do a bit of shopping tomorrow, I cook double today, then tomorrow there is no cooking. If I do a lot of kitchen cleaning, then I don't do laundry. If it's Saturday and I want to spend the day with my husband doing fun (but easy) things, then I don't have to cook, clean, do laundry or exercise!
**Strategies for Consistency**
I also make use of a second set of pacing strategies that help me live more consistently within my limits. Employing them brings greater stability and predictability to my life, as well as giving me better control of my symptoms.
**Rules**
I have used most of the strategies in the [program’s book](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/store) over the years, but *rules*are my lifesaver these days. My life has become more unpredictable in the last 2 years with watching over my very elderly parents. Unfortunately, my chemo, surgery, and subsequent downturn in energy happened at the same time, making the caretaking of my parents even more challenging.
Before I established my rules, the weekly shopping/doctor appoint trip with my folks was really 'pushing' for me, followed by a one or two day crash. Happily, the rules work well for Mom and Dad, too! So the rules became 'our rules'. They are:
- I only make one trip per week by myself - this rule is broken only by an essential doctor visit. My husband drives me once on the weekend to visit.
- I arrive at around noon and we try for Wednesday most weeks. Consistency is good for my Dad, too!
- We only have one doctor appointment per day. This rule is almost never broken.
- I don't go if it's raining or storming, unless it's for an appointment.
- I leave for home by 4:00 or 4:30 to avoid heavy traffic.
As new energy-sapping situations arise, I try to find ways to prevent or alleviate them. For example, the time my Dad shopped a bit too much and I had to help him carry the load to his room caused a big crash the next day for me! For a while a new rule of *no shopping for heavy items *was in place, but my husband suggested I get a rolling cart and it has been a big help.
**Forgiveness**
With all my rules around my special day with my folks, the trip has gone from 'pushing' to 'enjoying', and it is no longer the hardest day of my week, most of the time. Still, sometimes things go bad.
That is where *forgiveness *helps. My husband told me that life is full of compromises, and there will be hard days that I can neither prevent nor predict. Just accept it and don't stress about it, he says. Stressing about it only adds to the fatigue! He is so smart and supportive!
**Routines**
I use routines, and more rules, on the days that I stay at home. I rest more on those days, so I can have the energy to do a bit of shopping with my husband on weekends. I also listen to my body very carefully on my rest days.
**Stop and Choose**
I find *stop and choose*** **very helpful when I am out shopping. For example, while in the store to get a prescription, should I also pick up a carton of yogurt? I ask myself, "do you really have the energy to walk to the back of the store, or would it feel better to just go home now?" When I don't question myself, I am very apt to overdo it.
**Logging**
I *keep records*every day, mostly highlighting the big events. These records allow me to analyze what event might have triggered PEM. For me, PEM can be delayed by as much as 3 days, so I review the last 3 days. If I can figure out where I exceeded my limits, I can make appropriate changes to my pacing.
**The Bottom Line**
Although it’s a lot of work and it took time to put it all in place, the result of using all these strategies is that I am able to live mostly symptom-free and that’s something I wouldn’t have thought possible a few years ago. |

# Learning to Live Within The Envelope: The Importance of Rest and Rules | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Paula Smith is a CFS patient **from California who works as a website developer. She has been a part of the CFIDS & Fibromyalgia Self-Help program since 2014.*
After a year in the self-help program, I felt considerably improved, back to 60% of my former level of health and functionality from 20%. Four months later, I was dumbfounded by an extended period of Post Exertional Malaise. How had this happened when I thought I was doing everything “right”?
Luckily, the program’s class on pacing was starting at this point, and I was able to join. Through the course, I was able to do two things I previously thought impossible: understand my Energy Envelope and, most importantly, begin to find a way to live within my Envelope.
**Questions and Insights**
Since I was not able to see any correlation between what I did and my relapse, I asked the instructor for help. He asked me four questions about how I had been managing my health:
- What was different about the few days or a week before your relapse started?
- What do you think your energy envelopes are at this point?
- What correlation have you found between morning resting heart rate and symptoms?
- How many rests do you take each day and of what length?
With the questions in mind, I reviewed my logging data, journal entries and other records from the previous six months. Consulting my notes using the filter of these questions, I was floored. Contrary to my belief that I was pacing myself, I saw that I had gradually fallen back into some old habits, my symptoms picking up at a similar rate.
Rather than pacing myself diligently, what I had been doing was:
- Scheduling several “Big Events” per week, without scheduling time to rest before or afterward. I planned future commitments without taking into account what I had done in the past week.
- I was pushing at my work to sustain focus for several hours at a time. I was not scheduling rest breaks to prevent symptoms and often skimping on recovery rest breaks.
- What I called “resting” was actually multitasking: listening to the radio and playing iPhone games, not lying down with eyes closed as the program suggests.
In other words, I had slipped back into my pre-pacing mindset of taking on anything that I wanted to do, even if I already had a full plate. Also, I was stimulating myself too much in the evening and running a high sleep deficit. When I slept, it was unrefreshing. No wonder I had relapsed into Post Exertional Malaise!
**Experimenting with Scheduled Rests**
Having realized that I wasn't resting enough and my rests weren’t restorative, I decided to experiment with taking frequent rest breaks during my working hours, working at my computer for 45 minutes, then lying down on my bed for 15 minutes. I also gave myself an earlier bedtime and made evening rules to help overcome insomnia.
The first week of my experiment was quite instructive: I took 15-minute rests after each work period of 45 minutes. I was pleased and surprised at the results.
I was able to work longer billable hours, even when unable to leave the house. I had no brain fog or headache by the end of the day. I had no additional trouble sleeping, other than my usual insomnia. On the last day of the week, I had zero symptoms, awoke early, feeling bright and energetic. This was a HUGE change from the previous few months.
Resting my mind and body, even when it feels like I don’t need to, really makes a big difference in my overall experience. I am more productive because I know I only have 45 minutes until the next break. My mind is fresher throughout the day, and I have less anxiety.
Using this strategy of integrating planned rests into my work day, I was able to work my maximum billable hours and still recover from my intense crash. I saw how scheduled rest breaks can expand my productivity, even during a crash.
**Pigs at a Trough**
Excited by success, I went on to getting better at “Pigs at a Trough” scheduling. This is a pacing strategy that suggests limiting our scheduled actions to a few priorities rather than adding more and more tasks.
Just as there is limited space at a trough and the only way a new pig can get in is to squeeze another pig out, people with CFS and FM are better off thinking of “substitution” rather than “addition.” In order to add a new item to our schedule, we are better off replacing an item thererin.
I have developed a system of reviewing my schedule on a weekly basis. Knowing that I can handle a finite amount of Doing in a week, I look at the previous week’s activity and rest level, then look at next week’s schedule to decide if there is room for something new. Then I look at my calendar for the next week and make a plan for how to manage my commitments.
**Personal Rules**
Another pacing strategy I have learned to use is to have individualized personal rules. I developed my rules based on the results of my experiments with rest, physical exercise, social events and workload.
If I follow these rules, I will stay within my current energy envelope, able to be productive without triggering a relapse:
- I can do either mental activities or physical activities in a day, but not both
- I can work up to six hours in a day if:
I do no exercise and
I keep up my 45/15 work/rest pattern
- Even if I use rules 1 and 2, I also need to schedule weekend rest time and defend my evening wind down time. If I don’t, it will all fall apart.
- Even following all above rules, I need to be
**diligent** about limiting appointments, meetings and pleasurable events during the work week. This is a learned practice, it does not come naturally to me!
**Conclusion**
I was frustrated and overwhelmed with intense symptoms when I started the pacing class, and I didn’t know how I had gotten there. I was hoping that through the class I would learn better how to pace in a general way, but what I learned in the class was a breakthrough!
I learned that I can either work all day or do something physical, but not both.
I learned that my envelope is flexible but can be accurately described by my personal rules.
I now have three concrete practices that I have worked into my routine:
- 45/15 work/rest pattern throughout the day
- My “Pigs Plan,” scheduling practice, where I take a few minutes to plan how I will get through the week, and then amend this per day, keeping in mind the week behind and the week ahead
- My personal rules
Because of what I was able to do in the class and since, I feel well equipped to move forward while taking care of myself. |

# Controlling Symptoms Through Pacing | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Anne has CFS and FM, as well as several related conditions. She has been a member of our community since 2006 and has given talks on pacing and our program at the Bateman Horne Center in Salt Lake City, and its predecessor, OFFER. *
* *
In the article below, Anne describes how she uses multiple pacing strategies to control her symptoms.
For a period of time, my efforts to pace were often disrupted by changing circumstances, interactions with others and my own expectations as reflected in my self-talk, but by using the strategies described below I have learned to pace myself consistently and avoid the push/crash cycle.
**Listening to My Body**
The first strategy involves listening to my body’s messages instead of just doing what I think I should or what I want to do. I rate how I am feeling in the moment on a number scale. Doing this reduces the chance I will minimize my symptoms and increases the likelihood I will make decisions that support my body’s needs.
Also, I found that I pay more attention to how my body feels and, because of that, live more frequently within my limits, when I do mindfulness practices. I meditate and often conduct a body scan based on Jon Kabat-Zinn’s Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course. And I attend a class that blends Body-Mind Centering and Iyengar Yoga.
Acknowledging and accepting how I feel has enabled me to adjust my activity level over time to more accurately reflect my limits.
**Keeping Records **
My logs are the most accurate method I use to get perspective on my limitations. I have learned that I am more likely to make changes to my behavior when I have a written record that shows me the connections between my activities and my symptoms.
I have kept logs of individual activities such as diet, sleep, work and exercise, as well as logs of my activities as a whole. My records show me the causes of heightened symptoms. For example, recording stressful interactions and events has shown me how stress affects my symptoms.
When I am having trouble heeding my body's messages, seeing my symptom levels in black and white effectively warns me to reduce and/or change my activities.
**Thinking "Sustainability"**
I really like the idea of asking myself “what level of daily activity can you sustain over a week?”
To help me toward that goal, I keep a record of all my work and higher level activities, aiming to keep the hours the same every week. If I have more hours to do than normal in one category, I drop something in another category so that the total number of hours for the week remains consistent.
I use a calendar as well to spread out special events or activities across the month or months and arrange lower level days on either side of them.
Taking sustainability one step further, I aim to pace my activities during the week so that I have the same amount of energy on the weekend as well.
I have set up reminders for occasionally and annually recurring tasks and events on my calendar so that I can incorporate these into my weekly plan ahead of time. This prevents me from becoming overloaded unexpectedly and helps me maintain a consistent and sustainable level of activity.
**Using Personal Rules **
I have adopted rules around the length and frequency of trips outside of the house. I schedule work out of the house every other day. If I go out two days in a row for other things, I have a day at home afterwards. If I am out for a relatively full day, I stay home at night. Also, the rule to turn off devices by 8 pm has helped a lot.
Additionally, I have created a few guidelines that I follow. One is to stop doing things right away when I notice that I am experiencing worsening symptoms.
Second, when I am experiencing a lot of pain, I need to gently move my body, by doing Qi Gong, yoga, or stretching and/or walking, and then follow up with some form of relaxation. When I am having IBS symptoms, I am stricter about following the FODMAP diet for a couple of days.
**Using Routine and Reminders **
Maintaining consistent sleep and wake times is a routine I have worked to establish to reduce my symptoms and increase my energy. I start my routine of getting to bed by 9 pm so that I have quiet time to relax my body and mind to prepare for sleep.
Planning my meals in advance for the week is another routine that enables me to have more consistent energy during the week. On one or two days in the week, I make the plan, have shopping done and food prepped so that it takes me only about 15 minutes to make or heat each meal.
I have printed my limits on individual activities and my energy envelope and put them in a binder I review often. To remind myself of my weekly goals, I print them out on paper and record my progress there.
**Planning My Life and Living My Plan**
My plan is to follow my personal rules and honor the limits on individual activities and routines I have set for myself. Choosing jobs with a fairly consistent and/or flexible work schedule during my best times of day help me honor my self-management plan. To be able to live my life well, I need to maintain a regular rhythm of alternating sleep, activity, rest, moderate exercise, relaxation, and eating.
I have learned that scheduling in advance is central to carrying out my plan. I list all the things I have to do for the month and then break these tasks down into weekly priorities. I use a notepad that says “If I get nothing else done today, I must…” I identify the top three priorities in categories like calls to make, emails to send, work to do etc. and give myself permission to not do the rest if necessary.
**Using "Stop and Choose"**
Pausing to think about how I want to feel tomorrow and the next day helps me to make better decisions. I review my future plans and ask myself whether I can afford to do the activity in addition to what I have already scheduled.
I accept that I may not be able to do both or all and I choose the most important. While it may be easy to fall into thinking that I have do something, I remind myself that I always have the choice of what I do or not do.
**Learning Assertiveness**
Articulating my limits to family, bosses, fellow employees, and friends is essential to pacing myself consistently. I have come a long way with voicing my boundaries and needs related to my illness. I am learning that I can take care of myself and not compromise my health in order to meet others’ needs.
I can balance my personal needs with others’ needs better when I honestly express my boundaries. First, I need to be clear about my needs and personal rules. Then, I need to communicate them to others in a brief, direct way. If someone is repeatedly not respecting my boundary despite discussing it further, then I need either to limit or to avoid contact with them.
**Forgiving Myself **
** **
Adapting more forgiving self-talk around my efforts at managing my CFS/FM has reduced my symptoms.
Participating in the CFS/FM Self Help Courses has taught me to view my self-management as an ongoing learning experiment. I am interested in finding out what I can learn from each experience I have so that I can apply that knowledge in the future.
I have also utilized Martin Seligman’s principles in his book *Learned Optimism *to adjust my thinking. I focus on the positive things I have done each day even if there are other factors that I had a hard time controlling or couldn’t control.
When I write down something positive I learned from a challenging event, I notice I am less negative and discouraged and my outlook improves.
**Conclusion**
Pacing consistently has taught me that I can significantly influence my symptoms by how I live. I may not be able to eradicate them, but I can minimize them through my own efforts.
I have had to learn to do things differently, adopt new habits, and adjust my thinking. By using the strategies I described above, I have gained more balance, ease and control in my life. I spend my time proactively managing my symptoms and less time living in response to them.

# The Strategies I Use to Manage CFS and FM | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Anne has CFS and FM, as well as several related conditions. She has been a member of our community since 2006 and has given talks on pacing and our program at the Bateman Horne Center in Salt Lake City and its predecessor, OFFER.*
Learning how to pace through the CFIDS/FM Self-Help program enabled me to gradually gain control over my symptoms. Pacing is a primary tool I use to bring more stability to my life. Here are the strategies I use to help me pace myself and avoid the push/crash cycle.
**Delegating **
Delegating is a skill I use frequently. I participate in a program called Employment-Related Personal Assistant Services funded by the Department of Health and Medicaid. It enables me to hire help at home when I work 40 hours a month. I manage people to help me with cleaning, laundry, shopping, cooking and errands.
This requires me to be organized, to prioritize, to set boundaries and to communicate clearly. While this is work for me, it takes much less energy than doing the tasks myself.
It was challenging at first to admit I needed help, but I have accepted this fact of living with CFS/FM and it’s paid off. Delegating has improved the management of my symptoms and my quality of life.
**Planned Rests**
** **
Planned rest periods are something I have gradually incorporated into my routine. Before I go out for the day, I rest 5 to 20 minutes. If there is a convenient place to lie down while I am out, such as a park or even in my car, I will sometimes do that for 15 minutes.
I rest for 20 to 60 minutes as soon as I get home in the afternoon, with the length depending on my activity level that day. Often I listen to relaxation CD’s, but I also rest silently.
When I am at home all day I rest at least twice, at mid-day and mid-afternoon 20 to 45 minutes. To prepare for a longer day I will schedule one low level day beforehand so that I rest enough in advance. If I notice I am spending extra time in bed in the morning or before my normal bedtime, I know I need to do more planned rests during the day.
**Limits on Individual Activities**
Finding my limits for individual activities has been an immensely helpful strategy for learning to pace better. The best length of time for me to be outside the house is 6 hours, although it does vary. I have discovered through trial and error that my limit on working at a job is 12 hours per week in addition to my other activities. Working a 4 hour shift is ideal.
After sitting I need to get up every 90 minutes to move around. When required to stand in one place, I limit it to 20 to 39 minutes at a time. I limit cardio exercise such as walking and using the stationary bike to 20 minutes or less on certain days.
Setting limits helps me remember my tolerance to individual activities based on past experience. I can rely upon these limits to prevent me from overdoing.
**Mental Adjustments**
** **
How I perceive my physical and mental abilities and what I expect of myself directly affects how I pace. Letting go of my old expectations of what I could do is an ongoing process.
I remind myself I am valued for who I am, not what I do. It is important that I validate myself and my positive efforts to manage my health. By doing so, it has become easier for me to let go of needing approval from others.
For example, I have shifted my thinking about rest. I used to see it as a heavy burden; now I view it as an activity that enables me to do more things in the future, much like a savings deposit does. It helped me accept the value of rest when I calculated that resting 1.5 hours is only 9% of my day and 2.25 hours is only 15% of my day.
Thinking in those terms showed me that the percentage of time I rest is not nearly as high as I had thought. This helped me realize I still have a lot of time to live my life as long as I honor my body’s need to refuel on a regular basis. Adjusting my thoughts to be more in alignment with the reality of my health limitations is a key to being able to pace well.
**Limiting Sensory Input**
Logging helped me discover that my sensory input envelope was much smaller than I realized. I have needed to put limits on digital stimulation because it interferes with my ability to rest. I do not use more than one device at a time.
I try to limit phone calls to 30 minutes, or 1 hour maximum. I have turned on the Do Not Disturb option on my phone between the hours of 8 pm and 9 am. I either avoid or limit TV to 1 hour on certain days. Other times, I will turn the TV off by 9 pm at the latest if I want to get a good night’s sleep. In general, I avoid loud, busy places and large groups of people.
**Keeping Pleasure in Life**
Doing pleasurable activities is one of the most effective strategies to aid my pacing. It can provide distraction from symptoms, produce endorphins and trigger the relaxation response. At the same time, it lessons pain, stress and anxiety.
While at home I practice Iyengar and restorative yoga, progressive muscle relaxation and visualization exercises daily, all of which are great for relaxing and grounding.
Spending time outdoors while doing light exercise, gardening, seeing new places and appreciating nature rejuvenate me. I enjoy going to an early movie and dinner, watching comedy, reading books and doing artwork.
**Conclusion**
** **
While I resisted pacing at first for fear of not getting as much out of life, I discovered that it actually allows me to do more over the long-term by reducing relapses. More importantly, it led to significant reductions in my symptoms. Using these pacing strategies has given me a sense of control over my life and enabled me to improve my quality of life greatly.

# The Life or Death Decision That Improved My Life in Surprising Ways | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Margo, who lives in Missouri, has been a member of our community since 2011. In addition to this article, she also wrote *Exercising Safely Using Nano Steps (see: Exercising Safely Using Nano Steps).
Three years ago, I was in really bad straits, trying to live alone with a very severe case of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I was functioning at about 15 on the 0 to 100 [Rating Scale](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/files/rating_scale.pdf). I was miserable so much of the time, and so limited in what I could do, that my quality-of-life was practically nonexistent.
**Living a Very Limited Life**
At times I had to ride my scooter to get around the house. I struggled to climb the stairs to my bedroom and eventually switched to sleeping on my couch downstairs instead. I relied on processed food a lot, but as my food allergies accumulated, my nutrition became terrible.
I wore earplugs every day because sounds and audio were so difficult. I couldn't watch TV or listen to music or to relaxation recordings. Rooms were dim because I was so light-sensitive. I was isolated and the only internet device I could tolerate was my phone. I crashed often and I was utterly and completely miserable much of the time.
Often I sobbed and prayed to God, "Please, just take me! I can't do this anymore." I imagined being reunited with all my family members who have passed on. And with my dog, whom I still miss.
**A Strange Twist of Fate**
Then three years ago, a strange twist of fate led to some major changes for the good that I would never have imagined possible.
I found myself taken in an ambulance to the hospital and four days later had surgery during which doctors discovered ovarian carcinosarcoma, which is a rare combination of regular ovarian cancer and sarcoma. It's also really aggressive and it's got a terrible prognosis. And mine was advanced.
Whoa. Full stop.
After I got my staples out, I had a talk with the gynecologic oncologist about chemotherapy. He told me that if I did nothing, even after extensive surgery, my life expectancy was numbered in weeks, not months. He said we could try one round of chemo and if it worked and I tolerated it, do another, and so on like that up to 6. We could follow my progress with simple blood tests.
I realized in that moment that God had answered my prayers, in a way. "Look, here's your door out. Take it, or not. Are you serious about this, or not?”
**My Life or Death Decision**
I lay on the examining table, trying to make sense of it all. A friend was there with me, so I asked her what she thought. She said it wouldn't hurt to try one round of chemotherapy and see what happened. I realized she was right. I wasn't quite ready to walk through that door. The odds were against me, but I wanted to live. Agreeing with my friend, I told the doctor to proceed with chemo.
The infusions worked well and we continued through six rounds, which took about five months, including a couple of unscheduled hospital visits. What I went through during those months was probably the hardest thing I've ever done, but I got through it! My strength surprised me.
**The Surprising Consequences**
When I started the chemotherapy, I never imagined I would still be here, three years later, since the five-year survival statistics are poor. So I'm still not out of the woods, not by any stretch of the imagination, but my quality of life is better, and my attitude is different. I marvel that I'm still around!
Thanks to finding the right medications and getting home health aides who give me five hours of help a day, I don't feel as miserable and horribly depressed as I used to. And my sensitivity to light and sound is somewhat better.
I realize it's unlikely I will live to be 95 like my grandmother and my uncle, but for now, I'm thrilled to still be here!
No matter what my quality of life is like, I'm not ready to leave yet. I’m trying to live by a saying cancer patients sometimes use: "It may get me someday, but it won't be today." |

# Acceptance, Discipline & Hope: A Story of Recovery from CFIDS | Treating CFS & FM

|
Author's Note: I read with great interest Thomas Day Oates' article "Recovery," in the Summer 1995 [CFIDS] Chronicle. I agree that we each have the means to positively impact our health, which for some PWCs [People with CFIDS] may mean partial, and for others substantial, recovery.
That Mr. Oates is an extraordinarily spiritual and disciplined person I have no doubt. However, reading between the lines of his inspiring story one can see circumstances not available to all PWCs. I hope that my story will provide encouragement to those who, although ill, must continue to support themselves and who perhaps aren't as spiritual as Mr. Oates.
During my eight-year struggle with CFIDS, I supported myself by working part time the first several years, returning to full-time work as I gradually improved. From these circumstances it may seem that I wasn't as sick as a lot of PWCs, and this is probably true.
I would estimate that I "functioned" at about 60 percent of my "healthy" level, but my quality of life was reduced significantly below that (functionality not being everything in life, regardless of what the Social Security Administration folks say). Each day was a struggle to keep my job and the hope alive of better days to come.
Today [1995], nine years after the onset of my illness, I consider myself "substantially recovered," a term which I know begs defining. To me "recovered" means that I no longer dread relapses and that I have returned to a full and fulfilling life. It doesn't mean that I can indulge myself in certain former hobbies, such as endurance competitions.
It does mean that I can engage in vigorous outdoor activities at a level more or less normal for a person in his early fifties and that I can work full time, travel and enjoy an active social life. For these blessings I pay a small price: I live within certain limits. I pay attention to my body and stay in touch with my emotions. I accept a daily health regimen and I don't ever burn my candle at both ends.
I improved somewhat during my first five years with CFIDS, but the biggest gains occurred after the fifth year. I don't subscribe to the notion that one's chances of recovery diminish after a certain amount of time.
To believe that is, in my view, to reject the idea that one can, through one's attitude and behavior, affect one's recovery. At the same time I don't believe any of the remedies, medicines or food supplements I tried helped me one bit.
**To Accept or Not to Accept CFIDS?**
Over the years, I read several reports by recovered or improving PWCs where they said they started improving after "accepting" or "resigning themselves" to their illness. Until recently I rejected this mind-set as defeatist or fatalistic.
In America we are taught from early childhood that succeeding in life is important and that striving is the key to achievement. I initially viewed the healing process as one in which I would succeed through determination and hard work.
I realize now that there is a problem with this type of thinking. It leads to a roller-coaster ride of emotional highs and lows. During the years that I consciously "tried" to get well, I perceived remissions as steps up a ladder to recovery. The path would be ever upward. When relapses inevitable followed, I was devastated by the apparent failure of my will and my conscious efforts.
I believe today that a certain kind of acceptance may be important to recovery. It is not a resignation to one's fate as a sick person. Rather, it is acceptance of the reality of illness and of the need to lead a different kind of life, perhaps for the rest of my life. I know absolutely that I will never again enter a foot or ski race. I know I will live for the rest of my life within certain modest limitations.
I know that the term "moderation," which I previously despised, applies to me in spades and is in fact the key to my future well-being. The "effort" required to recover from CFIDS is an exercise in discipline and hopefulness, not determination and striving. The discipline required is exactly the opposite of the discipline so valued in the scholar, professional or athlete.
It is the discipline to recognize and adhere to one's known limitations and to follow a strict regimen without periodically lapsing. It is the discipline not to succumb to family or societal pressures to get back into the rat-race. It is the will to protect oneself, to not over-do and to find ways to be productive and find fulfillment under unfamiliar and difficult circumstances.
**The Healing Attitude**
I can attest to the value of some of Thomas Day Oates' coping and healing techniques described in the Summer, 1995 CFIDS Chronicle:
(1) Keeping a daily journal of the substances and activities which seem, no matter how subtly, to contribute either to remission or relapse
(2) Categorizing all foods and drinks as either stressors or helpers
(3) Eliminating negative influences (people, attitudes, emotions, etc.
(4) Learning to be alone in silence (and especially learning to live without television).
During the first few years of my illness, I harbored resentment and anger toward my ex-wife, former bosses and business associates whom I felt had short-changed me. I also felt a certain amount of guilt and regret over past failures and problems I had caused others, including my children.
Perhaps it is healthy to allow negative emotions to flow freely in and out of one's consciousness, but it is decidedly unhealthy to allow negative emotions to control one's thought patterns and being. If I can't enjoy a book, a favorite piece of music or a conversation without my mind drifting off into regret or revenge fantasies, then I know my subconscious is in control.
There are two basic ways to deal with this: either delve into your past and try and get at the root of learned "programs" which usually stem from childhood, or work at changing your attitude. I have found the latter more productive. As Alcoholics Anonymous teaches, changing one's behavior is a good way to develop a more positive attitude.
**Onset and Initial Stage**
In December 1986, feeling sick with flu-like symptoms, I went to a general practitioner for a checkup and was diagnosed with a mild case of mononucleosis, which the doctor said was self-limiting and normally required six weeks to three months for complete recovery.
When I asked him if I should curtail my ski training and racing (I had been active in cross country ski racing for about 10 years at that point) he said no, if I felt good enough to train, "go for it." I skied conservatively two or three more times and then decided to stop training entirely.
However, in mid-February, having felt normal for a week or so, I skied a 30 km course in Sun Valley, Idaho, where my two children were competing. The next day the flu-like symptoms returned in force and worsened in the following weeks.
I experienced memory lapses, difficulty concentrating, crushing fatigue after a few hours in the office, insomnia, low-grade fevers, tender lymph nodes and a constant sore throat. With my company's concurrence, I reduced my work schedule from over 10 hours a day to six or fewer.
My wife asked me for a divorce the same month I became sick and I moved out of the family house. I accepted the need for and reality of the divorce intellectually, but felt emotionally out of control for several weeks. A toxic brew of grief, anger, sadness, frustration and resentment ebbed and flowed.
In May 1987, not having even begun to recover, I saw Dr. Daniel Peterson, whom I read about in an article about "yuppie flu." Two months later Dr. Peterson, after conducting a series of tests to exclude other possible diseases, diagnosed CFIDS.
I saw Dr. Peterson periodically for the next eight years and regard his steadfast support as invaluable. To be sure that I wasn't developing complications or new problems, he periodically ordered various tests.
When some started to indicate improvement (after three to four years), it gave me a basis for hope. Above all, he listened and let me know that he believed I was doing everything I could to recover.
**Developing a Recovery Strategy**
During my first year of illness, I didn't know anyone else with CFIDS. I didn't know where to turn for advice and support. My basic attitude was that if anyone recovered, I would. Dr. Peterson's best guess was that, in general, about 20 percent of PWCs recover, while 60 percent improve somewhat over time.
I visited a chiropractor, a homeopathic doctor and an acupuncturist without any perceived benefit. I began to realize that recovery might depend solely on my own efforts, and with that insight, I began formulating a recovery strategy.
My first consideration was whether or not to work (and, if so, whether full- or part-time). I decided to work six hours a day, which I estimated to be the maximum time I could cope (in spite of feeling terrible) and also the maximum time I could work without risking deterioration of my condition over time.
(The company I worked for developed renewable energy sources. My employers were primarily interested in my ability to get power plants up and running.)
I believed I still could, especially if I could remove myself from the pressures of the home office. I sought assignments in remote areas, where I could control my daily schedule without others looking over my shoulder as I came and went. Controlling my schedule freed up time for naps, meditation, visualization and relaxation.
My second decision was whether or not to exercise. Dr. Peterson recommended that I do light exercises for 10 to 15 minutes a day. After a few months I decided I had to risk doing more because my sleep, appetite and hopeful attitude were being compromised.
I felt both ill and slothful and watched in horror as my muscles atrophied. Before getting sick I was an exercise junkie, hooked on a daily fix of endorphins and adrenalin.
I experimented systematically with progressive levels of exercise. I used a heart-rate monitor to gauge the intensity of my workouts and I carefully recorded exercise duration and how I felt before, during and after each workout, and especially how I felt the next day.
The penalty for over-exercise was a relapse which started about 24 hours after the infraction and lasted a week or more. Once, when I let someone talk me into going hiking, the penalty was a relapse of several months.
Third, I questioned what treatments to take. I found that other seemingly credible PWCs were experimenting with an array of remedies, including various herbs, tricyclic anti-depressants, gamma globulin, Kutapressin, homeopathic treatments and vitamins in heavy doses. I tried several of these without ever noticing improvement.
Fourth, I had to decide how to live on a daily basis. Should my regimen be flexible or rigorous? Should it allow for spontaneity and surprise or be carefully structured and controlled. Where did family and friends fit in?
**Living a Recovery Strategy**
During the first three or four years of my illness I didn't know that I was living a recovery strategy, because I didn't know whether or not I was recovering. I was experiencing a frustrating cycle of relapses and remissions with no end in sight.
The penalty for each "overdoing" mistake seemed far out of proportion to its seriousness. After about two years, and in spite of setbacks, I realized that if I didn't exceed my known limits, I probably wouldn't decline. But I wanted to recover.
**Exercise **
I learned that by paying close attention to my body I could do far more exercise without relapsing than Dr. Peterson thought I should be able to. I came to understand that the best time for me to exercise was in the late afternoon or early evening after a nap. Exercising in the morning left me exhausted by mid-afternoon.
I came to appreciate the importance of exercising in pleasant surroundings and in a calm mood. I learned that right kind, intensity and duration of exercise for me. This consisted of a combination of alternately jogging and walking (depending on how I felt) and strength exercises (such as push-ups). The important thing was to not force the pace and to allow adequate rest between exercises.
I received immediate benefits from exercise: improved appetite, more restful sleep, a sense of accomplishment and an instantaneous feeling of peace and hope. Perhaps most important was learning to enjoy exercise without succumbing to the urge to compete or "train," which meant I had to give up any idea of progressing - of doing more push-ups or of jogging farther or faster.
Eventually, I was able to increase the exercise (years later, not weeks or months), but it was a bonus of recovery, not a conscious goal. Had I set training goals, as healthy people do, I would have invited not only a succession of relapses, but also discouragement and perhaps demoralization.
**Work **
I gradually learned to pace myself to stay within my limits. A lunch break out of the office was helpful, especially if I ate a light salad or pasta dish and time was left for 15 minutes of upright dozing or meditation. Leaving the office by 4:00, whenever possible, was important. Following work, a full-hour nap followed by 20 minutes of healing visualization made exercising in the evening thinkable.
On business trips, a nap on arrival at the hotel put me in touch with my body and shut off the adrenaline. I learned to say "no" to late dinners. I didn't exercise on business trips, because I lost touch with my energy level when out of my home environment. I learned not to eat after 7:00 pm and never to take overnight flights, no matter how many of my peers were doing it.
**Social Life **
It was difficult to decide whom to tell about my illness. I told long-standing friends, close business associates and women I dated after my divorce. These people needed to understand the reasons behind my restricted activities and schedule.
To others, including most business contacts, I avoided disclosing it and tried to act as normal as possible. I suffered through many a workday feeling like death warmed over, but putting on a show of normalcy.
It always saddened me when fellow support group members would say "my doctor (or husband or wife) says I'm practicing illness behavior and wants me to act normal." These are exactly words PWCs don't need to hear and shouldn't take to heart.
What they do need to develop is the fortitude to accept their condition, even when others refuse to, and the discipline to do the things and adopt the hopeful attitude which will put them on a path to recovery. I hope that my experience may help other PWCs to find their own paths to recovery. |

# Living Within My Envelope: A How-To Story | Treating CFS & FM

|
*[Note: The following article was written in November, 1998 and published in the March/April 1999* CFIDS Chronicle*, the magazine of the CFIDS Association of America. The author is a graduate of the CFIDS Self-Help course. Before becoming disabled with CFIDS in 1993, she had developed a management consulting business following 25 years as a corporate executive.]*
In a study of the "envelope theory" reported in *The CFIDS Chronicle*, Fall 1997, the researchers found that individualized treatment programs can help PWCs [People with CFIDS] achieve their optimal level of activity and manage their illness more effectively.
"Living inside the envelope" sounds easy, but it hasn't been for me. Seven years I've had CFIDS and only now am I finally, mostly, living inside my envelope. It's been an arduous process of discovery and letting go.
## Phase I: Keeping on with my life
When it comes to CFIDS, I am definitely a s-l-o-w learner. From early 1991 I was having increasing symptoms. Despite feeling awful, I continued my busy life. Convinced that exercise must be good for what ailed me, I was still working out five days a week.
By mid-1992, though, it was getting harder and harder to carry on. I took more vacation time hoping that would help but without result. Neither daily meditation nor shiatsu massage helped, though the latter felt wonderful.
## Phase II: All-out effort to get well
In January 1993, I finally collapsed, unable to stay upright. But did I stop "working"? Oh no; I simply transferred all my drive, determination, and ambition from earning a living to getting well. I tried everything that made sense to me, but made myself sicker in the process.
For example, as soon as I had recovered a bit from that first crash, I resumed daily exercise, though I gave up running. I tried "power walking" an hour every day for several weeks until I collapsed again.
Thus began a pattern of exacerbation, forced rest, remission, return to activity, exacerbation, and so on. Between 1993 and 1997, I tried yoga, intensive meditation and visualization exercises, but experienced worse symptoms. I tried homeopathy with no result. I tried eating my main meal at noon and going to bed by 9:00 p.m. with no improvement in sleeping.
I tried elimination diets; no change. I tried a macrobiotic diet, and had a bad exacerbation. Anti-depressants brought new and worse symptoms. Sleeping medications and melatonin magnified my sleep disorder.
The only thing that relieved my symptoms was bed-rest, but I couldn't believe I was sick enough to have to stay in bed. Over and over, as soon as I recovered somewhat, I tried to live a normal life. Little by little, though, I was being forced to reduce my activity further. I stopped house-cleaning. Then I stopped cooking. I stopped taking walks and I stopped shopping.
I became convinced that none of the strategies or treatments to which some people with CFIDS attributed their recovery would work for me. Gradually, I was shifting my focus from seeking to learn from others to paying more attention to myself and my own experience. And I stopped striving to recover. Instead, I began to pay more attention to myself and to listen to my body.
## Phase III: Learning from my own body and experience
In February 1996 I broke two bones in my foot and was in a cast from my toes to my knee for seven weeks. The combination of heavy cast and lack of the strength immobilized me. Months later, when I was trying to make sense of my records, I realized that I had felt better during and for a few weeks after my immobilization than at any other time for over five years.
That's when I decided I was going to find out, by carefully watching myself and keeping systematic records, what I had to do to feel better. Until then I had been recording my symptoms and noting when I felt worse. But in the fall of 1996 I decided to change the emphasis, vowing to identify the conditions associated with feeling better.
I began by developing my own definition of a "good" day. A good day for me is one in which I have minimal fatigue, muscle aching, or IBS--my most frequent symptoms; have no other symptoms from my repertoire of twenty-some; do not over-eat, which I'm driven to do by the drained emptiness of fatigue attacks; take a walk; and do artwork.
I also decided to focus on "good nights" as well, since sleep disorder is perhaps my most difficult problem. Lying awake for hours every night is harder to cope with than most other symptoms, it has persisted over time and it exacerbates other symptoms.
Over time I discovered that if I stayed in bed, eyes closed and resting, long enough, I could usually get about seven hours of fragmented sleep. And when I got seven hours of sleep, I felt better the following day.
I concluded that a good night was one in which I slept at least seven hours total; had refreshing sleep; and could lie awake resting peacefully, not agitated and frustrated. (A meditation practice and an eye pillow help tremendously. Even so, it took months to train myself to lie still while awaiting sleep.)
Good days and good nights are interdependent. After a good night, I'm more likely to have a good day. On days when I stay within my envelope, I'm more likely to have a restful rather than agitated night. Since I dread bad nights even more than bad days, this was a further incentive to discover my limits.
So then I asked, what do I have to do to have good days and good nights? After studying my journal and notes, I concluded that I must spend at least twelve hours a day in bed, resting, meditating, and sleeping; get at least seven hours of sleep; stay at home; restrict my daily activity to personal hygiene, climbing two flights of stairs in our three-story house, and walking about a mile; care for houseplants only when able to; work at the PC no more than an hour at a time; have no visits or long phone conversations; and do artwork.
This is my envelope. Staying inside it, I have the least fatigue and other symptoms and I feel as good as possible. That doesn't mean I don't exceed these limits. I do, and I pay for it.
## Phase IV: Developing a feedback system
Having established criteria for good days and nights and having clarified what I need to do to achieve them, I then worked out my record-keeping system. I use a monthly planning calendar with two-inch square blocks for each day on which to indicate the good days and nights.
I also note my activities and symptoms each day. Color coding with hi-liters enables me to see readily how I'm doing during the month. I find this kind of visible feedback motivating. I want to do what I have to do to show more violet (good) days and nights.
To see trends over the year, I graph my monthly percentages of good days and nights. On a calendar for the year, I put colored dots to show the days on which I experienced stress--visits, phone conversations, unusual activity, or other exertion.
The correlation between clusters of dots on the calendar and the ups and downs of the percentages of good days on the graphs is very apparent. I also chart my sleep pattern daily. I needed to make this information visible to prove to myself the effects of mental and emotional exertion, as well as physical activity.
I also wanted concrete evidence of the effects of staying inside my envelope. Because limiting my life in this way is so very hard for me to do, I had to show myself that it was worth it.
## Phase V: Accepting my envelope
Analysis of several years' notes showed me that mental and emotional exertion provoked symptoms as much as physical activity. In fact, I may suffer more symptoms following an hour's conversation than after walking in silence for an hour. It's not that I had never noticed the effects of being around people. It's that this is not a fact I wanted to admit.
For several years, while cutting back on physical activities, I could not accept and acknowledge my intolerance for interacting with people or the physical pain I have after mental exertion. I was not prepared to give up visits, especially with grandchildren, and phone conversations with family and friends. I didn't want to limit my work at the PC.
Doing so for the past year, though, has shown me what a difference solitude, silence, and inactivity make in my well-being. Fortunately, my loved ones are supportive. Fortunately, too, and to my surprise, I have found how contented I can be in seclusion.
This is not a prescription for anyone else. It is simply what I have learned about what I need to do to feel better.
## Results
So how am I doing? In 1996, a retrospective analysis showed I had 36% good days. In 1997, I aimed for over 50% good days and achieved that.
My experience in 1998 has not been as good due to the stress associated with my Social Security Disability Insurance claim (which was finally granted almost three years after my initial application) and a major relocation from our home to a retirement community--a great change in living situation.
Nevertheless, I have had three months this year of better than 70% good days, so I know what's possible.
My records for the past three years assure me that I am finally doing what I have to do to accommodate CFIDS. More importantly, during this period, I have had eight separate months with over 60% good days and I can account for the bad months. I know what I did or what happened that exacerbated my symptoms.
I've also learned that it is possible, by staying inside my envelope consistently for weeks at a time, not only to have no crashes, but to have exceptionally good days when I feel almost well. I've achieved more stability; I'm less victimized by the turmoil of the exacerbation-remission roller coaster.
## Summary and Conclusions
In summary, I have established my own criteria for assessing my days (and nights, because nights are so problematic for me) so that I could identify good ones. I clarified what I have to do to have good days and nights.
In other words, I described my envelope. I developed a record-keeping system (calendars, graphs, and charts) that help motivate me to stay inside my envelope. As a result, I am feeling much better and I am living with CFIDS much better.
As I review my story, I ask "Why could I not see for so long and accept what I had to do?" I think it's because it was so hard to make feeling good my top priority. Believing I should just soldier on no matter how I suffered, I was not able to insist on what I needed to make me feel better.
I was not willing to make the changes, to give up so much that was dear to me and central to my self-image. I wanted and was determined to continue my normal life when CFIDS was insistently demanding that I live differently.
To feel good, I have to be so unlike myself: self-indulgent, irresponsible, lazy. It seems clear to me now that living "normally" is not good for me, but I also know that I can live well with CFIDS in body, mind and spirit. |

# Controlling Symptoms by Setting Limits | Treating CFS & FM

|
One part of pacing is setting limits. Limit setting means that you stop doing some things entirely and reduce the amount or time spent on others.
You can find an example of the former in Eunice Beck’s article [Making a NOT TO DO List](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/library/making-a-not-to-do-list). Constructing a list of things you no longer want to do gives you permission to take things off your “should do” list, eliminating activities without feeling guilty about it. Having a “not to do” list gives you a justification for taking steps to protect your health.
Eunice Beck includes in her list “not volunteering or being manipulated into commitments that I know will be a strain on my energy and pain level.” She also lists putting the needs of others before her own.
You can find a good example of the power of setting time limits on activity in Bobbie Brown’s article The Many Reasons Why I’ve Improved (see: The Many Reasons Why I Improved). Bobbie used limit setting and other strategies to increase her functional level from about 15% of normal to about 35% or 40%.
Two items in Bobbie’s list refer to medications, but most of her strategies involve changes in her daily habits and routines. She uses pacing techniques, such as taking regular, scheduled rests and living within limits. In fact, almost half her items are techniques for setting limits on herself, including limits on:
- Driving
- Computer and phone time
- Stress and sensory input
- Socializing
- Travel and time outside the house
- Household and family responsibilities

# Lifting the Fog | Treating CFS & FM

|
Like the other major symptoms of CFS/FM, brain fog is best addressed by using a combination of strategies and by developing new habits.
When people in the self-help program are asked to describe what they do to combat cognitive problems, they often give lists that are ten items or longer. Here is one person's description of how she handles cognitive problems.
*My brain fog is worst when I'm exhausted, so I try and stay within my energy envelope. The fog episodes have greatly diminished since I learned that. *
*Over the last several months, I've gotten organized. Orderliness helps to prevent panic and fog. And when I'm too tired and foggy to think, I put things off until the next day and get extra rest instead. *
*I use self-talk too, saying "this too shall pass" or "nothing catastrophic will happen if I don't do this right now." That keeps me from going into panic mode and meltdown. *
*I'm mentally sharpest in the morning before I get really tired, so I schedule all my brain-heavy activities in the morning and leave the simple tasks for afternoon. I also nibble some protein every couple of hours.*

# How I Learned to Prevent Relapses | Treating CFS & FM

|
After I developed ways to reduce the length and severity of setbacks, I began to ask what could I do to prevent them. I decided that to gain control over my setbacks, I would assume that I caused all of them.
This was a high standard, especially because one of the hallmarks of chronic illness is symptoms that wax and wane for no known reason. But I wanted to hold myself accountable.
Perhaps part of the reason for this approach was that believing I was responsible also enabled me to believe I could gain control. This assumption led to many helpful discoveries.
By avoiding those things that created relapses, I was able to smooth out my life considerably, reducing both the frequency and severity of relapses, and eventually eliminating them. Believing I caused my relapses gave me hope that if I could change how I lived, I could bring setbacks under my control.
I began my attempts to eliminate relapses by defining them as symptoms so severe that I had to spend at least one full day in bed. My records for 1998 showed eight relapses, almost all caused by secondary illnesses and travel.
I then developed strategies to prevent future setbacks. By taking extra rest for several days after the symptoms of a secondary illness had ended, I eliminated relapses triggered by colds and other short-term illnesses.
I used several strategies to minimize travel-related setbacks. First, I limited my travel to destinations that were only a few hours’ driving distance from home. Second, I scheduled extra rest before, during and after my trips.
Third, I added a ten to 15 minute rest stop for every two hours of driving. (As I improved, I eased these limits, eventually traveling just as I had before becoming ill.)
Another travel-related strategy was to plan my trips in great detail, especially how much activity I would have. Making a commitment to myself to stay within a safe activity level helped me resist the temptation to do too much when on the road. Also, I told my travel companions of my limits ahead of time and they helped me honor my plans.
The bottom line: since initiating these changes, I never had another relapse.

# Family Visit Success Story | Treating CFS & FM

|
Anything out of the ordinary --a vacation, holiday celebrations, moving, or for people with serious CFS or FM, just going out of the house for any reason-- can creates a relapse, but you can make a special event more manageable if you use three strategies explained in the article Travel and Other Special Events (see: Travel &amp; Other Special Events):
1) Take extra rest before, during and after
2) Plan in detail
3) Discuss your plans with others
Here's an example of using the strategies to reduce greatly the price of a special event. It comes from Rose, a woman who had been bedbound for a decade at the time of the event, although she improved substantially in the years that followed.
For several years during the time she was bedbound, she had annual week-long visits from her daughter and granddaughter. These visits triggered relapses that lasted about six monthly each, a big price for a week with her relatives. The long relapses motivated her to try something different.
She did three things before the visit. First, she reduced her usual activities for several days prior to the visit, using the time for extra rest.
Second, she created a plan for the visit. It involved alternating days of socializing with days of quiet rest, and also changing how she spent time with her granddaughter to focus on quiet activities.
Third, she explained her plan to her daughter, who accepted it and discussed it with her daughter.
During the visit, Rose spent time with her granddaughter every other day, but in a quiet way that did not overwhelm her.
After her visitors left, she spent two days resting and then resumed her normal activities with no relapse.
Instead of a family visit leading to a months-long relapse, it was an experience of control through pacing.
She said about the visit, “I had never even come close to surviving a visit from my granddaughter since developing CFS/FMS. It absolutely thrilled me that we were able to make some special memories together without it being damaging for me.”
She used the same strategies to manage other visits by her daughter and granddaughter, including a much longer visit that occurred almost three years after the initial success. |

# How I Learned to Minimize Relapses | Treating CFS & FM

|
No matter how consistently I lived within my envelope in the first two years I was ill with CFS, I would periodically find myself back in bed with symptoms that were so intense that I couldn’t do anything but pull the shades, climb into bed, and wait for a better day.
These relapses, which usually lasted from one to three days, were greatly demoralizing as well as painful. They were so frequent and so devastating that I decided that I had to develop strategies to combat them.
The first challenge was to determine what I could do to reduce the length and severity of my relapses. The number one answer was to rest. Staying in bed until I felt better was the quickest and surest was to improve.
Stating that obvious truth to myself was helpful because it gave me permission to acknowledge that at times I was powerless over my illness and the best strategy was to give in to it.
I also found that what I told myself during a relapse was important. Lying in bed for hours on end, many negative thoughts would swirl through my head, things like “you’ll never get better” or “you have no control over your illness.”
Knowing that worry made relapses worse and that relaxing helped me recover, I learned to speak consolingly to myself, saying things like “you’ve recovered from all the other relapses, so just relax” or “you’ve been doing well lately, this is just a temporary interruption of your progress.”
And I reasoned with myself, saying things like “all your previous setbacks have responded to rest, so this one will probably end too.”
I also found talking to other people on the phone helpful. We didn’t even have to talk about my relapse or even about me; just having a sense of connection with another person was reassuring. Also, listening to someone else talk about themselves distracted me from my symptoms and worries.
I observed that often a relapse would have two parts. After resting for a day or two, I would feel somewhat better, but then the relapse would resume. Either I was too eager to return to my normal activity level or my body was giving me misleading signals about my recovery.
In any case, the strategy I developed to avoid a double dip was to return to normal gradually rather than as soon as my symptoms disappeared. If I took more than my usual amount of rest for a day or two after I thought I was OK, I could avoid slipping back into a relapse. I motivated myself to take the extra rest by visualizing what I would feel like if I didn’t take the extra rest.
Another strategy I used to minimize relapses was to give in as soon as the first symptoms appeared. By doing this, I found I could stop a minor relapse in its tracks. I stumbled upon this strategy one day when I was cooking. After standing at the stove for 45 minutes, I suddenly felt tired and lightheaded.
My first thought was: “If I can just work for another 10 minutes, I can finish this and then go rest.” But, remembering how many times such an approach had led to several hours’ rest, I decided to turn off the heat and lie down. After about 15 minutes, I felt OK and returned to finish the cooking. I needed no more rest during the remainder of the day.
I was able to use this strategy many times, especially in combination with meditation. When I felt increased brain fog, for example, I found I could eliminate it if I could lie down and get into a deep relaxation for five or ten minutes.

## detail-58-How-I-Treated-Fatigue.html

# How I Treated Fatigue | Treating CFS & FM

|
I began my recovery program by developing my strategies for fatigue, my most persistent and disruptive symptom.
I remembered from my previous experience that fatigue could have multiple causes, each of which might be addressed by different strategies. I identified eight possible causes for my fatigue besides my illness.
|
* *
|
*Activity Level*
|
|
Being active beyond my limits |
|
|
*Inactivity *
|
|
De-conditioning from having a lower activity level
|
|
|
*Poor Sleep** *
|
|
Sleep was not restorative, leaving me feeling tired |
|
|
*Pain *
|
|
Pain can lead to muscle tension, which is fatiguing |
|
|
*Stress** *
|
|
Stress produces worry and muscle tension
|
|
|
*Depression*
|
|
Low spirits produce sense of listlessness
|
|
|
*Poor Nutrition ** *
|
|
Lose energy if don’t get enough food or lack right foods
|
|
|
*Medications*
|
|
Drugs can cause fatigue as a side effect
|
Activity level seemed the most crucial to me. There was an obvious relationship between the number of hours a day I was active and my fatigue, though the effects were sometimes delayed a day or two. If I was active for more than about four hours in a day, I later experienced elevated fatigue. Rest produced a reduction in my exhaustion.
Ironically, I found hope in my discovery that I created some of my own suffering. If the connection between activity and fatigue was so direct, then I might be able to gain some control if I found a level of activity that my body could tolerate. Finding an amount of activity I could sustain was one of the foundations of my recovery.
The other factor that seemed especially promising was inactivity. I knew that highly-trained athletes become deconditioned if they stop exercising for even a brief time, so I was sure that part of my fatigue was due to my lower activity level. If my aerobic capacity had diminished, then I would become fatigued more easily by activity. I thought the way to fight this was through exercise.
Through experimenting, I found I could recondition myself without increasing my symptoms if I walked about 20 minutes a day at a pace that raised my heart rate to 90 to 95 beats per minute. As I improved, I was able to increase the length of my walks gradually and eventually returned to hiking.
Improving my sleep also seemed worth pursuing. I knew from other patients that sleep was often nonrestorative for people with CFS, but I thought I could help myself to some degree by maintaining good sleep-related habits.
I thought I could reduce my morning sluggishness if I maintained regular hours and avoided things like late nights on the computer. So I made it a rule to turn off the TV and stop using the computer at 9 p.m. Those strategies, too, were helpful.
Once I developed my approach for fatigue, I asked myself if I needed additional strategies for poor sleep and pain, my other major symptoms. After some experimentation, I concluded that all three symptoms were responsive to the same strategies and, by and large, I didn't need separate strategies for each symptom.
Limiting my activity level, taking regular rests, and reducing stress reduced all three symptoms and helped improve my mood as well.
When diagnosed in 1997, I functioned at about 25% of normal. Using a self-help approach, I improved step by step and over a period of about four years, gradually returned to my pre-CFS life.

## detail-59-Paying-Attention-to-Time-of-Day.html

# Paying Attention to Time of Day | Treating CFS & FM

|
Most people with CFS and FM find they have better and worse times of the day. It's likely you can get more done, without intensifying your symptoms, by changing when you do things, so that you use your best hours for the most important or most demanding tasks.
One person in our program wrote about exercise, "If I walk in the evening, I can make it around two blocks, but three has me collapsing. Early in the day, I can do three or more. I have a window between 8 and 11 in the morning that is best for most activity, both mental and physical."
Another person was bothered by the effects of brain fog on her ability to read and retain information. Studying in the morning, she was able to read for only a half hour a day and had trouble remembering what she read.
Then she decided to experiment with studying in the afternoon. She found that she had good mental stamina for several hours if she started the afternoon with a brief rest. After her rest, she could read for two 30-minute sessions with a short break in the middle and retain the information.
Over time, she expanded her study time to a total of two hours a day. Experimenting with time of day enabled her to increase her study time greatly while also increasing her comprehension. |

## detail-60-Combining-Exercise-and-Rest.html

# Combining Exercise and Rest | Treating CFS & FM

|
I was able to extend the length of my walks only slightly in the first several years I was sick. From time to time, I tried extending my walks by a few minutes a day, but most of these experiments produced increased symptoms, leading me to return to my previous level.
After two years, I was walking about a half hour a day, not much different from the 20 minutes or so when I was first sick and very much less than the 15 miles or more a day I hiked before CFS.
I was finally able to expand my exercise in a significant way when I incorporated rests into my walks. I discovered how I could apply rest to exercise when I went walking one day with another CFS patient, a person who had a more severe case than mine.
She stopped frequently, about once every five minutes. I noticed that I wasn’t at all tired at the end of our hour-long walk, and asked myself whether I might be able to extend the length of my walks by incorporating rest into them.
So I tried an experiment. The next day I walked for 20 minutes, then sat on a bench for a 20 minutes, then walked some more. It worked! I was able to walk significantly farther than before by including a long rest in the middle.
This was a big psychological breakthrough, as it opened the possibility of longer walks without an increase in symptoms. I was able to extend gradually the distance I could walk, as long as I alternated periods of walking with equally long periods of rest.
Over a period of several years, I returned to doing hikes as long as those I took before getting CFS.

## detail-61-Using-Scheduled-Rest-to-Prevent-Symptoms.html

# Using Scheduled Rest to Prevent Symptoms | Treating CFS & FM

|
When I was first ill with CFS, I often experienced cycles of push and crash. If I was more active than my body could tolerate, I experienced intense symptoms and then used rest to recover.
Spending a few hours or a whole day in bed was an effective strategy for recovering from periods of doing too much, but my life felt out of control.
About nine months after becoming ill, I learned that I could use rest for another reason besides recuperation. I found that rest could actually prevent higher symptoms.
I decided to try resting every afternoon, but I wasn’t sure what “rest” meant. Was I resting if I was reading or watching television? Or did rest mean lying down? I did some experiments and found that the most restorative rest resulted from lying down in a quiet place with my eyes closed.
I was surprised at the results from a 15 minute rest. Even that short rest seemed to help, reducing my symptoms, increasing my stamina and making my life more stable. After a while I added a morning rest as well.
Over time, I came to believe that my scheduled rest was the most important thing I did to aid my recovery. Resting everyday according to a fixed schedule, not just when I felt sick or tired, was part of a shift from living in response to symptoms to living a planned life.
The experience showed me that rest could be used for more than recovering from doing too much; it could be employed as a preventive measure as well. In the terms suggested by one of the students in our self-help program, I learned the difference between *recuperative* *rest *and *pre-emptive rest*.
Taking pre-emptive rests enabled me to reduce my total rest time, because I spent so much less time in recuperative rest. Resting on a planned schedule greatly stabilized my life, enabling me to get off the roller coaster and giving me a much greater sense of control.

# Illness and Housekeeping | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Nancy is a long-time fibromyalgia patient who lives in California. She has led many self-help programs, including many years as a moderator in the CFIDS & FM Self-Help Program. *
People with chronic illness often have problems with housecleaning and the control of clutter. Once a home reaches a certain stage of disarray, it can seem hopeless. Living this way contributes to emotional distress and social isolation, as people feel embarrassed about having guests.
All these things once applied to me, but I have learned how to keep a clean and orderly house, and it has made a big difference to my life and to how I feel about myself.
**My Problems**
My ability to do housework had gradually decreased over the years as my health declined. In response, I tried to enlist help from my family and set up a schedule so everyone would do some of the chores around the house.
I didn't get much cooperation, so I hired a house cleaner to come in once a week. Even with that, clutter still kept building up and eventually the cleaning person found an excuse to quit.
Neither my husband nor myself understood why I couldn't keep the house clean and picked up. I blamed myself for being lazy. Our house became so messy that I was embarrassed to have people over. I stopped inviting the neighbors in. Pretty soon the only people who saw the inside of our house were our daughters and their husbands.
**Steps to a Better Life **
There was no one simple answer to making my home a clean, organized and welcoming place. Rather, it took a combination of a lot of things to go from chaos to comfort. If I found a secret, it was to identify small practical steps I could take and then to do them one at a time.
A first step was getting medical help for my various ailments: sleep apnea, hypothyroidism, arthritis, asthma, allergies, and fibromyalgia. Doing what I could to improve my health made it easier to tackle the housekeeping problem. Treating my sleep apnea with a CPAP made me less sleepy during the day.
Getting on thyroid medication helped my fatigue, mental confusion, and depression. Addressing my arthritis helped me to avoid further injury to my joints. Treating my asthma and allergies helped my overall energy. Education helped me to deal better with my fibromyalgia.
At about the same time, I began seeing a counselor who specialized in helping people with chronic health problems. She told me that most people with chronic illnesses mistakenly think that they are lazy.
With her help, I came to realize that I would do the housework if only I felt well enough. It took nearly a year, but I finally realized that when I am tired, I should rest. I hadn't done that before. I would just soldier on with a project until it was completed or I collapsed.
I have carried the idea of resting one step further since joining this self-help program: I rest before I get tired. I meditate twice daily, and I also lie down to rest for fifteen minutes with my eyes closed once or twice a day.
With my counselor's encouragement, I worked out better systems for dealing with clutter. For example, I sort the mail as soon as it arrives, instead of letting it pile up. I throw away or recycle what I do not want. I put the bills in a safe place, and I put the mail I want to look over later in some bins placed on shelves by my chair.
I didn't try to reform everything at once, but rather I changed things gradually. For example, I noticed that our bathroom vanity top was so filled with bottles, jars and other things that I could barely use the sink.
In a moment of clarity, I realized that I didn't use all these things every day; in fact, I didn't use some of them at all. I went through everything, throwing most of them away and storing under the sink the few things I use regularly. It was tough at first, but I was able to keep the vanity top clear using the strategy of not putting anything down on it.
For about a year the vanity top was the only reliably clear area in our home. But, one area at a time, I started applying this method elsewhere. Little by little, I cleared and organized different parts of our house.
When I had a big project like cleaning a closet, I didn't try to get it done in one day. Instead, I would assign myself one shelf or one rack of clothes to go through on a particular day.
Sometimes it worked best if I simply told myself to do 15 minutes worth of work and stop at the end of that time. The next day I did another 15 minutes, until eventually the whole closet was clean and organized.
Also, I congratulated myself for my efforts and for what I had accomplished, even if I didn't do as much as a healthy person. I came to see that, like other chronically ill people, I am always making a huge effort, so I always have something for which I can congratulate myself. And focusing on what I had done was much better for me psychologically than blaming myself for what was yet undone.
With my new understanding of progress through small steps, I had success involving my family by asking them to use a similar strategy. I found that it was much easier for them also to handle one small part of a task at a time or to work on a project for only 15 minutes.
Even if they didn't do a job the same way I would, they still accomplished something. And they were much more cooperative about neatness after seeing a system that worked.
It took me several years to move from chaos to a neat and organized home. One reason it took so long was because I was not just cleaning house. I was re-training myself in my approach to housework. Although I had many setbacks, I didn't give up. I just focused on the immediate tasks I had set for myself each day, and I praised myself for each effort I made--even if it was not successful.
I established simple routines to help me, like sorting laundry into three hampers and laying out each day's clothes in advance. When my husband and I finish a meal, we each take our plate, a serving dish, and our silverware to the sink, and we encourage guests to do the same.
I found convenient and logical places to store things, and I trained myself to put things back when I was through using them. I got rid of things we didn't need. I kept projects simple, and I cleaned up after myself as I went along.
On some low-energy days it seemed like all I accomplished was keeping things in their proper places. But that is an important part of housekeeping. And I praised myself for the effort I was making.
**Moving **
About a year ago, my husband and I faced a big challenge: moving to a smaller home. In preparation for the move, we divested ourselves of over half of our possessions. That process was made easier because I had already been doing a lot of thinking about what was important to me, and they were things like family and friends, not possessions.
I gradually came to realize that all the things we owned were not enriching our lives. Instead, they were making housekeeping virtually impossible, and they were keeping us from moving to smaller and more practical quarters.
A first step for me was making lists of possessions that I was sure I wanted to keep. If I wasn't using it and I didn't love it, it didn't make the list. I spent about a year pondering the value of my various possessions.
To make the move, I ruthlessly pruned away what I did not need or want. I did not move things by myself. I got other people to come in and take things away. I called in relatives, charities, collectibles dealers, auction houses, and junk haulers to take things away. We did not get much money back for the things we got rid of, but the important point is that we were free of them.
In our new home, we hired a cleaning service and also a gardening service. We had to face the reality that since I was ill and my husband was working long hours running a small business, we needed the help. So we pinched our budget elsewhere.
Looked at from a certain standpoint, household help is a medical necessity. With continued practice of self-help strategies, my health has improved, and for the past few years I have been able to dispense with professional cleaning help. Now I clean our house myself with some help from my husband.
**In Summary **
I would summarize the changes I have made as: keeping my expectations realistic, delegating some tasks, establishing routines, picking up after myself, pacing myself, resting before I get tired, and praising myself for the effort I am making.
All of these involve discipline applied a little at a time. I found that discipline is not an unwelcome burden, but rather a way of taking care of myself.
The result of my efforts is a house that is a clean and welcoming place for me and my husband. And I feel comfortable having company drop in at any time!

## detail-63-Developing-an-Understanding-of-My-Limits.html

# Developing an Understanding of My Limits | Treating CFS & FM

|
Using the term Energy Envelope helped me get a general idea of my limits, but I made much more progress in controlling my symptoms when I understood my limits in detail.
I decided to focus on limits in different parts of my life when some fellow patients pointed out to me that mental activity and stress could be just as draining as physical activity. I began to ask myself a series of questions in order to get a fix on my limits and needs in different areas of my life.
I asked myself: how much mental activity (reading or computer work, for example) can I do in a day? how much in a single session? what are the stressors in my life? how much sleep do I need at night? how much daytime rest? how long can I drive safely? how long can I stand at one time without intensifying my symptoms? how far can I walk?
I was also concerned to find my limits in other areas. In addition to those just mentioned, I included activity limits (which I define as how long I could do various activities like housework, shopping and spending time with people without intensifying my symptoms), food sensitivities, sensitivity to light and noise, and emotions.
Over time, I ended up with a list of about a dozen items that I listed for myself on a form I called “My Energy Envelope.” It took me at least a year to develop this more detailed understanding, but I felt rewarded all along the way because every limit I defined helped me gain more control. I filled out the form once every several months and found it a helpful way to assess how I was doing in some detail.
Later I added a section to the end of my definition, in which I summarized my abilities and limits, noted my greatest vulnerabilities (for example, stress, secondary illnesses and travel) and set goals for myself. This section was a helpful summary of my current situation and also suggested where work might give the biggest payoff in reduction of symptoms.
One surprising discovery I made in studying my envelope was that my limits were more restrictive in some areas than in others. For example, when I thought I had recovered back to about 60% of my pre-illness level overall, I could do only about 30% as much exercise.
I found it very helpful to share my envelope definition with family and close friends. Getting outsiders’ views of my situation helped me to be more realistic in my self-assessment and also helped others to understand me better. So, I felt greatly rewarded by the time I had spent understanding my limits in detail.

## detail-64-Activity-Adjustments-for-Lower-Symptoms-and-Higher-Productivity.html

# Activity Adjustments for Lower Symptoms and Higher Productivity | Treating CFS & FM

|
People in the self-help program report lower symptoms and greater productivity by changing how they are active: using short activity periods, spreading activity over longer periods of time, and switching among tasks of varying difficulty.
**Short Activity Periods**
Two short periods of work with a break in between can produce more and leave you feeling less symptomatic than the same amount of time expended in one block.
One person reported on her sense of accomplishment, saying "Even though I have reduced the amount of time that I allow myself to do a task (kitchen 10 minutes, computer/reading 15-30 minutes), I am amazed at the end of the day how much I have actually done."
Another person reported on how she breaks activities into very small units. For example, she divides cleaning the bathroom into a number of tiny steps: getting out the cleaning things, wiping down the sink, bench and mirror individually, sweeping the floor, shaking out bathmats, wiping down the bathtub, and so on.
Her approach is to do half of an activity at a time or to use an egg timer to keep to a time limit. For example, she might only wipe down the sink, then return later to do the taps and the bench around it. She will divide the time for dinner preparation into fifteen minutes blocks. She says, "I generally don't go for longer than half an hour with any activity, and the more strenuous it is the less time I spend on it."
It is still possible to accomplish a lot even with very short activity periods, as shown by the experience of another person in the self-help program. This woman, who is severely limited because of CFS, was asked to translate two documents from Chinese into English.
Through experimenting, she found she could work at her computer for only 15 minutes at a time before feeling ill. She decided to have four work periods a day of 15 minutes each for a total of one hour. She completed her translations in five months. Later, she was able to expand her work periods from four to eight a day.
** **
**Activity Shifting**
Another strategy for getting more done is activity shifting. Some people use this idea to move from one type of activity to another, for example switching between physical, mental and social activities.
Other people divide their activities into different categories of difficulty. They schedule only a certain number of the most taxing activities a day and make sure to switch frequently among different types. Here’s what one person does:
*I divide activities into light, moderate and heavy, and then plan my day to alternate activities in the different categories. By pacing myself in this way, I can do more and minimize my symptoms. In fact, I’m amazed at all I can now do in a day.*

## detail-65-The-Four-Pacing-Strategies-That-Helped-the-Most.html

# The Four Pacing Strategies That Helped the Most | Treating CFS & FM

|
I tried almost every pacing strategy I heard of, but four proved crucial to my recovery.
**1) Pre-Emptive Rest **
I've called my twice daily 15 minute rests "the secret to my recovery." Taking time out twice a day reduced my symptoms, increased my stamina and made my life more stable.
Just as important, it gave me a sense of control. Instead of living in response to symptoms, after using regular rests I felt I was planning my life again. This started a "virtuous cycle" in which increased control reduced my anxiety, which in turn gave me a greater sense of control.
**2) Logging**
Record keeping was the second most important strategy and something that took only one or two minutes a day. My logs showed me the connections between my actions and my symptoms, helped me hold myself accountable (black and white proof of being outside my envelope!) and motivated me because I could see progress.
**3) Consistency in Activity Level**
I gained a lot of stability when I asked myself what level of activity I could sustain for a week. Initially, I was caught in push and crash because I set my activity by how I felt on any particular day.
Then I replaced that with a similar level of activity every day. I came to believe that I could control my symptoms by maintaining a consistent activity level and that I might be able to improve if I kept my activity level below my body's limit (to free energy for healing). That strategy worked!
**4) Supportive Self-Talk**
I changed my internal monologue to be supportive of my efforts, focusing on gains rather than failures and speaking in a reassuring way to myself when things went bad ("remember how all the other relapses have ended, so have patience").
In sum, the key to improvement was to live according to a plan, rather than in response to symptoms. Logging showed me what activity level my body could tolerate. Positive self-talk kept my spirits up in tough times.

## detail-66-Consistency-A-Key-to-Pacing-Success.html

# Consistency: A Key to Pacing Success | Treating CFS & FM

|
In my mind, consistency is both a major challenge and the key to success in pacing. Of the strategies I investigated, I found six especially useful and crucial to my recovery.
**1) Record Keeping**
This was probably the foundation of successful pacing for me. I used records of my activities and symptoms to define my limits. Once I understood my limits, my records were a source of motivation, showing me how much better my life ran when I stayed within my limits.
I spent some time reducing the things that made my symptoms worse, but my main motivator was the positive idea of increasing the things that gave me control.
2) Adjusting Expectations
Although it was a gradual process, probably taking two years or so, I gradually changed my understanding of what was reasonable for me. Instead of comparing myself to healthy people or what I could do before becoming ill, I slowly developed a new way to look at myself based on what my body could actually do, not what I wanted it to do.
I think that acceptance of limits is related to working through loss. For me, the belief that I could have a good life whatever my limits was crucial to accepting my losses.
3) Routine
I agree with Dean Anderson, whose recovery story (see: Acceptance, Discipline & Hope: A Story of Recovery from CFIDS) is included in the Success Stories on this site. What helped me was to learn to live my life in a new and different way.
I thought of myself as replacing one set of habits and routines with a new set, a big challenge but one that got easier over time as more and more of my habits supported my recovery.
**4) Visualizing Consequences (Stop & Choose)**
To avoid overdoing when I was tempted to go outside my envelope, I often thought of how I would feel later on. I tried to be as detailed and graphic as I could be: sensing the 'run over by a truck' feeling in my body and imagining myself lying in bed in a dark room for a day, etc.
5) Personal Rules
Because I was often bothered by brain fog, which could make me very confused, I developed rules for myself. I wrote the three most important general principles on a 3x5 card that I could refer to in moments of confusion. (One of my rules was to make changes gradually, so I guess I used at least seven of the consistency strategies.)
I also developed very specific rules I could remind myself of daily, like "take a 15 minute rest at 11 am and 3:30 pm."
6) Forgivness
Over time, I came to see that beating myself up for my failures to pace was very expensive. It made me feel bad and it did nothing to improve things.
I learned more friendly self-talk, focusing on the asking myself "what can I learn from this?" and "what should I do now?"
Over time, I found that consistency built on itself. Consistency led to a lower level of symptoms declined and also to greater stability. Those payoffs motivated me to be even more consistent. |

# Two Special Anti-Depression Strategies | Treating CFS & FM

|
Depression can be a debilitating part of CFS and fibromyalgia, but its duration and severity may be lessened through planning.
One person in the self-help program, recognizing that depression is likely to recur, has created two special anti-depression strategies that she uses when she's feeling blue. Both keep her active, which counters the listlessness and hopelessness that are often part of depression.
The first is called "The Treasure Box of Pleasantries." It's a notebook containing compliments she has received, photos of places she has visited or would like to see, plus treasured notes, photos and cards. When her spirits are down, she picks them up by going through the box.
The second strategy, which she calls "The 100 Hours Program," is a way to stay active and give herself a sense of purpose when her spirits are especially low. She scripts a period of up to 100 hours with "every special, pleasant and meaningful activity I can think of." Depending on her functional level, she might schedule hair and massage appointments or lunch with friends.
In addition, she has a list of 50 activities she can do on her own. They include catching up on unread magazines, watching uplifting or interesting movies, perusing picture books and preparing easy-to-fix meals.
Everything is worked into a schedule, which she keeps in a binder. She says that usually by the end of the time she is back to normal. The most important part is that "I don't have to think ‘what do I do now'. I've planned it all out beforehand."

# Moving Beyond Loss | Treating CFS & FM

|
CFS transformed me in a matter of days from a healthy person to someone functioning at 25% of normal. As my symptoms persisted, I came to realize that CFS was not a temporary interruption but rather had become the central fact around which my life revolved.
Much of what I considered “me” had been taken away. The losses brought by illness created one of my greatest challenges in living with CFS: redefining myself in the face of loss.
**Denial, Hope & Acceptance**
One of my responses to the loss of my old life was denial. I told myself for more than a year that I would be the exception, one of the lucky ones who recovered. This belief enabled me to keep hope alive and to adjust to all the losses and uncertainties.
Later, when I accepted that recovery was unlikely, I found hope in the progress I had made and in the conviction that, even if didn’t recover, I could still find ways to bring meaning to my life. Also, gaining some control over the illness helped reduce the amount of uncertainty in my life.
People say that the last stage in grief is acceptance. For me, acceptance meant recognizing that my life had changed, perhaps permanently and certainly for an extended period of time.
It meant letting go of my past life and also of the future as I had envisioned for myself. But it had another component as well, a confidence that I could find things to improve my life. I called the combination *acceptance with a fighting spirit*.
CFS stripped away most of what I viewed as myself. Because of my illness, I gave up work and volunteer commitments, let most relationships slide, lost my ability to be physically active, and replaced an optimistic view of my future with uncertainty.
**Coping with Loss**
I did two things to cope with my losses. The first was to publicly acknowledge the loss. In a Christmas letter sent a year and a half after getting CFS, I wrote to friends that I had been living with a disease for which there was no standard treatment or cure.
I concluded: “I am sobered by the realization that it is highly unlikely that I will return to the level of functioning that I had before becoming ill and so probably will have to adjust to living a life with greater limits than before.”
Even though I wrote to alert others to expect less of me in the future, I think the more profound effects were on me. The public declaration helped me recognize the extent of my loss and the possibility that it was permanent.
While accepting that my life had changed, I had the conviction that, whatever happened, it would still be possible to have a good life. That conviction helped me to accept the losses I had experienced. I continued to believe that even if I didn’t recover, there were many things I could do improve my quality of life. This belief kept me moving forward in hope.
**Support from Others with CFS**
Within weeks of receiving my diagnosis, I joined two local CFS support groups. The experience was especially useful for the friends I made, one from each group.
Both were very generous with their time, spending many hours talking to me about the medical, psychological, and political aspects of CFS. They were tremendous sources of information and perspective, helping me to understand CFS much more quickly than I could have on my own.
Beyond these two relationships, being a part of the support groups gave me a sense of belonging, an experience of being connected to others like me. I found there is something powerfully healing about feeling understood, all the more so for a stigmatized disease that some people, even some doctors, don’t believe is real.
Because I stopped working and dropped out of my volunteer commitments shortly after becoming ill, fellow patients became perhaps my most important community.
I think having that source of identification served me well. I took CFS patients to be my peers, not healthy people. That meant that I measured myself in comparison to them, not to my peers from work or healthy friends. That comparison took a lot of pressure off.
I firmly believe that we all need to have meaning in our lives. My way to bring meaning to my new situation was through relationships and from the belief that, even though I had lost much, I could still contribute something.
Helping others through the self-help program, both provided an opportunity to create many new relationships and gave me a new sense of purpose when previous sources of meaning had been lost.

# Experiences with Pre-Emptive Rest | Treating CFS & FM

|
Scheduled or pre-emptive rests have been one of the most popular strategies among people in the self-help program. Here is what some people have written about their experience with planned rest:
*I have been resting in between activities, sometimes only for five minutes. For the first time in the four and a half years that I have been ill, I feel that it is possible to manage my symptoms and have some predictability in my life.*
*[Right after starting the class,] I decided to incorporate two scheduled rests into my day and the results have been incredible. My symptoms and pain have decreased and I feel more 'in control'. My sleep has been more refreshing and even my mood has improved.*
*Since I've been forcing myself to rest every day, I have found I have more stamina. And I've noticed the graph of my days doesn't dip and rise so steeply.*
**Finding An Optimal Rest Schedule**
It often takes some experimentation to find the number and length of rests that works best for you. As the last quotation above suggests, some people find it helpful to take several daily pre-emptive rests, rather than one or two.
This can lead to a reduction in total rest time, especially for people with severe CFS or FM. They can easily go outside their limits and trigger post-exertional malaise. Taking frequent short rests is one way to avoid malaise.
The experience of one person in the self-help program illustrates this. When this woman started the class, she was resting six hours during the day, taking two naps of three hours each. After learning about pre-emptive rest, she decided to break up her day into one- and two-hour blocks, and to take a 10 to 15 minute rest during each block.
Over a period of two months, she reduced her total rest time by an hour and a half. After six months, she had cut her rest time down to three hours a day. By resting in small blocks, she added three hours of activity time to her day without increasing her symptoms.
Pre-emptive rest can be especially useful for people with severe CFS or FM. A bedbound CFS patient wrote that before she took the self-help course she thought she was nearly always resting because she spent most of her time lying down. Through the class, she realized that she was actually quite active, talking to people on the phone, working on the computer, etc.
She was initially apprehensive about trying scheduled rest, because she feared it would reduce her activity level. But she told herself that quiet, pre-emptive rests, "by allowing my body to recuperate and even heal, would give me more opportunity for activity in the spaces between them."
Her verdict after several months of integrating frequent rest periods into her day: "I am absolutely amazed by just how much impact resting has on my overall well-being. The effects have been instant and quite phenomenal. It's turning out to be the best treatment I've ever tried. And it's free!!!"
## Using Pre-Emptive Rest for Travel and Exercise
You can apply the idea of planned rests in many parts of your life. For example, I used it for several years to expand my envelope for travel.
I found that if I stopped during driving trips for a ten to 15 minute rest every two hours, I arrived fresher at my destination and had a lower symptom level throughout my trip. I reduced my symptoms further while traveling by doubling my usual daily rest times.
Rest is commonly recommended for exercise routines: exercise-rest-exercise-rest. While I was recovering from CFS, I used rests to expand the length of my walks. I found that if I walked for a while and then sat down for an equal amount of time, I could walk substantially farther without increasing my symptoms.
Breaking up my walks with rests also enabled me to begin hiking up hills again, instead of being limited to level ground. For some people, the rest periods may be longer than the time spent exercising, but the principle is the same: controlling symptoms by alternating periods of exercise with times of rest. |

## detail-70-What-Exercise-Taught-Me-about-CFS.html

# What Exercise Taught Me about CFS | Treating CFS & FM

|
Before I got CFS, I enjoyed taking long hiking trips, so it was a big shock to find that with CFS I could walk only about 20 minutes a day. I made many experiments with exercise, learning many lessons about CFS and extending my limits as my body allowed. Eventually I was able to return to the mountains.
**Finding Exercise Limits**
When I was first ill with CFS, I was attracted to walking both because I enjoy exercise and because I thought that exercising would help reduce the fatigue due to de-conditioning. But how much exercise could I tolerate without making my symptoms worse?
I tried walking for different lengths of time and at different speeds, keeping notes of how I felt both during and after exercise. I found that if I walked for about 20 minutes at a speed that pushed my heart rate up to but not beyond 95 beats per minute, I could get some aerobic value without making my symptoms worse.
**Time of Day**
Through experimenting with walking at different times of day, I discovered that exercising in the afternoon was much less likely to lead to a higher level of symptoms than exercise in the morning.
If I walked in the morning, 20 minutes was likely to tire me out, but the same amount done in the afternoon did not produce much if any increase in my symptoms. So one lesson I learned from experimenting with exercise was that when I did it was as important as how much I did.
This realization led me to ask whether this was true generally. I found that my illness had a pattern. I often woke up feeling tired, no matter how many hours I slept. My symptoms were generally at their peak in the morning, but I had a period of several hours from mid-afternoon through mid-evening when they decreased.
I found consolation in this insight. If I could get through the morning, I knew I had some good hours coming. Also, if I had something important to do, it was better to schedule it in the afternoon.
**Delayed Reactions**
There were days when I felt so good during my walk that I decided to extend it beyond my usual 20 minutes. Sometimes I went as long as 40 minutes, without any increase in symptoms while I was walking. I soon realized, however, that when I walked longer than usual I had a higher level of symptoms later that day or even the next day.
The realization that the effects of exercise might be delayed prompted me to ask whether this was true of activity in general. After some record keeping, I concluded that it was and, more disturbingly, that I could not trust the signals sent from my body.
As a healthy person, I used fatigue and other clues from my body as a way to tell me to slow down or take a rest. But with CFS, the signal was delayed, sometimes by hours or even a day or two.
So I was faced with the question: how can I control my symptoms if I can’t trust my body to warn me when I am overdoing it? I decided to keep careful records of my activities and symptoms, correlating activity level with subsequent increases or decreases in symptoms.
Over time, I discovered my “safe” activity level. But this was a process of analysis and deduction, not awareness of my body in “real time.” I found I could control my symptoms by staying within those limits.
**All Activity is Exercise**
On some days, I felt quite tired even when I walked my usual amount. I wondered whether it might be due to poor sleep the night before or because of stress. While those factors explained some of my fatigue, I decided that a more frequent explanation was my total activity level.
Checking my records, I discovered that times of increased symptoms were often associated with days I did laundry, housecleaning, grocery shopping, cooking or some combination of those activities. All of them required that I be physically active while standing.
This led me to state a rule for myself: “All physical activity is exercise.” My energy level was so low when I first got CFS (about one quarter of my pre-illness level) that I needed to be aware of all my activity. For several years, I noted household chores and shopping in the “exercise” column of my health log.
**The Body is in Control**
It felt unfair to be able to walk 20 minutes or so and feel fine afterwards, but to have to spend an hour in bed if I walked 40 minutes. The difference was so small in comparison to the length of my hikes in the past that it seemed I was being punished disproportionately by CFS for going only a little outside my limit.
Painful as it was to realize how little “cushion” I had, how tight my limits were, the discovery led to a recognition that there was no way I could argue with my illness or persuade it that it was being unfair to me. I learned that I couldn’t expect a “free day” if I had been good for a week. I saw my illness as harsh and unyielding, a force that could not be tricked or persuaded.
The recognition that my body was in control was a crucial part of acceptance: like it or not, that was my situation. In other circumstances earlier in my life, I might have been able to ignore my body by staying up late and just pushing through to finish a project. But CFS had reversed my relationship to my body: now the body was in charge.
**Exercise and Rest**
I was able to extend the length of my walks only slightly in the first several years I was sick. My practice was to make small extensions (no more than a few minutes at a time), but to return to my previous level if symptoms increased. I made little progress. After two years, I was walking about a half hour a day, not much different from the 20 minutes or so when I was first sick.
I was finally able to expand my exercise in a significant way when I incorporated rests into my walks. In retrospect, I am surprised that it took me so long to recognize that rests could help my exercise endurance, given my use of daily rests at home.
I discovered how I could apply rest to exercise when I went walking one day with another CFS patient, a person who had a more severe case than mine. She stopped frequently, about once every five minutes. I noticed that I wasn’t at all tired at the end of our hour-long walk, and asked myself whether I might be able to extend the length of my walks by incorporating rest into them.
So I tried an experiment. The next day I walked for 20 minutes, then sat on a bench for a 20 minutes, then walked some more. It worked! I was able to walk significantly farther than before by including a long rest in the middle. This was a big psychological breakthrough, as it opened the possibility of longer walks without increases in symptoms.
I was able to extend gradually the distance I could walk, as long as I alternated periods of walking with equally long periods of rest. Planned rests during exercise also enabled me to begin walking again in areas with uphill stretches.
**Uneven Recovery**
Three years after becoming ill, I was able to walk on occasion as much as seven miles, a big improvement on 20 minutes a day but roughly a third of what I could do before CFS. I felt discouraged when I compared myself to the past, but was helped by noting that my recovery overall put me back to about 75% of normal.
The experience helped me to see that my recovery was uneven, better in some areas than in others, with exercise tolerance lagging the most.
**Back to Normal and Beyond**
My discipline and patience paid off over time. On a trip to the mountains in my fourth year of illness, I took a hike of 15 miles. The next year, I had a trip on which I averaged almost 15 miles a day over four days.
The year after that, I hiked about 90 miles in six days. Late in 2003, I had a trip on which I was able to walk even greater distances than before I became ill: 18 miles a day. And to celebrate turning 65 in 2009, I had a trip of 162 miles.
By extending my exercise very gradually, as allowed by my body, I have returned now to a level of exercise equivalent to or perhaps even better than my pre-illness level.

# How I Use Pacing to Manage CFS | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Bianca Veness, a CFS patient from Australia, is a moderator in the CFIDS & Fibromyalgia Self-Help program. *
I spent many years living outside my limits in an exhausting cycle of push and crash. Then, through the self-help program, I learned how to pace myself and listen to my body.
By using pacing, I can manage my symptoms (and the housework). I've reduced the number and severity of flare-ups and life is a lot less stressful.
Pacing is not one thing for me, but a set of techniques I use to manage my CFS. My pacing strategies include:
**Taking Scheduled Rests**
I have found that regular small rests spread evenly throughout the day stop me from 'hitting the wall' (that is, reaching the point where I feel seriously ill and absolutely have to lie down). I have four and a half to six hours of rest each day, usually in 15 to 30 minute sessions.
I find being flexible with the length and times of my rest breaks each day, provided I get the same overall amount of rest, helps me manage my symptoms without feeling stifled by routine.
During some of my rest breaks, I listen to relaxing music or books on tape or use guided relaxation CDs. I also have some quiet rest time when I don't listen to anything, but use relaxation techniques like breath awareness, body scanning or focusing on sensory awareness.
I also use visualization techniques to imagine my body getting well. Some people see resting as a passive activity, but I see it as a proactive health strategy, a time I can use to feel better and release any worries and stresses. Rest is my best medicine!
**Staying Inside My Energy Envelope**
Another concept I use from the self-help program is the energy envelope. This term means that CFS or FM imposes limits on us and that we can control our symptoms to some extent if we live within those limits, rather than fighting them.
When I first began pacing, I wrote out a detailed energy envelope, trying to be as specific as possible about things like how far I could walk without tiring, how much housework I could manage each day, how much sleep and rest I needed, and what made my illness worse (environmental factors, foods, secondary illnesses, etc).
This gave me a general picture of what I could manage each day, and I used it as a guide in developing pacing strategies and setting targets for myself. I review it every few months.
Creating my envelope was a great motivator for me, because it showed me that I could a lot more each day than I thought, as long as I kept within my limits and didn't overdo it on days when I felt ‘well'.
It has helped to reduce my symptoms because it evens-out the amount of activity I do each day, helping me get out of the push-crash cycle. Living within my envelope, I'm able to stick to a regular (but flexible) amount of activity and get more done in the long-run without damaging my health.
**Planning and Prioritizing**
I try to stay organized by using calendars, To Do lists and reminder notes. Every night before bed I write a To Do list, numbering the activities (never more than five) for the next day in order of importance, then I put the list up on my wall.
In the morning, I plan my day based on activities from this list. I also keep a long-term To Do list on my computer or in my diary, with a list of the things to get done over the next few months. I use this to set priorities for each day and week.
To Do lists help me to plan ahead and stay within my envelope, but also give me a sense of achievement as I tick off each item - on bad days it might be as simple as ‘have a shower', but at least it's something I've achieved!
I also keep a calendar which helps me prioritize my week and limit my outings, as well as being a record of symptom events like migraines or flare-ups. If I have a project I'm hoping to complete, I'll frequently write out a three-month plan with goals for each week.
Even if I'm unable to follow it due to illness, writing it all down helps me to prioritize, and to see where I can reduce or eliminate activities, and where I can get help from others.
**Preparing**
I find it beneficial to plan for events and outings ahead of time. I try to do as much as possible the day before - packing my bag, planning my route and transportation, and writing a list of things to get done while I'm out.
I give myself time limits for outings, because I find I can make bad decisions for my body when I'm out and about. Of course, sometimes I end up exceeding my limits anyway, but the planning helps me limit the damage.
I also prepare in a similar way when traveling. I make packing lists, sort out travel arrangements well in advance, and plan my activities to reduce worry and stress.
**Activity Switching**
I change from one activity to another frequently. For example, I switch from mental exertion (like using the computer or reading) to physical (like washing up) before I lie down. Changing from one type of activity to another helps reduce brain fog. I've also found it's helpful to make the transition from rest back to activity in steps.
After a rest, I first do a gentle activity and then switch to something more strenuous. I developed this strategy after I noticed that doing strenuous activity (like hanging out the washing) right after rest is much more tiring as my body isn't prepared for it.
**Breaking Up Activities**
I break every activity into the smallest possible units. For example, I break cleaning the bathroom into a number of tiny steps: getting out the cleaning things, wiping down the sink, bench and mirror individually, sweeping the floor, shaking out bathmats, wiping down the bathtub, and so on.
I only do half of an activity at a time or I use an egg timer to keep to a time limit. For example, I might only wipe down the sink, then return later to do the taps and the bench around it. Or I might time my dinner preparation and stop after fifteen minutes. I generally don't go for longer than half an hour with any activity, and the more strenuous it is the less time I spend on it.
**Record Keeping**
I keep some kind of health diary everyday, which I change depending on what part of my life I want to work on at the time. I've kept sleep diaries, food diaries, symptom journals, activity logs, rest charts and research diaries (where I keep notes on what I'm learning about CFS, health and nutrition).
At the moment my doctor and I are working on improving my digestion, so I'm keeping a chart of my IBS symptoms. This helps me feel I'm better managing my IBS, because I use it to make connections between certain foods and flare-ups, and I can see if medications are really having an effect.
One diary I find particularly helpful is a positive action diary. Every day, I write a list of the things I have done that day that have been good for my health.
This might include resting, eating good food, having a warm bath, doing relaxation or gentle exercise, visiting the doctor, pacing my housework, setting targets, or any number of things. I find it's a great way to focus on the positive and motivate myself to do even more.
**Pacing: My Daily Rhythm**
By using planned daily rest breaks, activity limits and the other pacing strategies I've mentioned, I've gained a sense that I am controlling my illness, rather than the other way around.
Using pacing techniques in a flexible way gives me a sense of freedom, as I feel I am listening to and heeding the needs of my body and living with the rhythms of the day, not forcing myself into an unmanageable routine.
By staying within my energy envelope, I am liberated from feeling awful, and I can truly enjoy life once again.

# Pacing and Exercise | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Bianca Veness, a CFS patient from Australia, is a moderator in the CFIDS & Fibromyalgia Self-Help program. *
For many years, I didn't exercise regularly because I couldn't figure out how to exercise in a way that didn't make my symptoms worse. Then I realized that it might be possible to exercise successfully if I applied the idea of pacing in this part of my life, just as I had elsewhere.
Thinking about exercise in terms of staying within my limits, I changed my goal from trying to get fit (very hard to do with CFS) to relieving some of my symptoms.
I began doing light stretches several times a day. I chose to do significantly less than I was able, so that I wasn't fatigued at all by the activity. I started with a level I could do even on my worst day, which was five minutes.
This approach worked. I now stretch gently for three or four minutes at a time, three or four times a day. This amount of stretching has greatly reduced my neck and shoulder pain, and the number of migraines I get. Stretching is the most helpful strategy I have found for treating my pain.
I am trying to extend my stretching slowly and add some strengthening exercises too, at the rate of about a minute a week. I only increase the time if I'm finding the stretches easy, otherwise I maintain the same time.
Because the stretches have been so helpful, because they don't fatigue me and because I enjoy them, I've been able to maintain my exercise program with no problems so far.

## detail-73-My-Energy-Bank-Account.html

# My Energy Bank Account | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Vicki Lockwood, a writer and retired paralegal, is a CFS/FM patient from Missouri and a graduate of the CFIDS and Fibromyalgia Self-Help course. Her articles have appeared in magazines and newspapers. *
For a long time, I had known that overdoing resulted in flares, but I had not given myself permission to limit my activities. Then I did something simple that changed my life in a dramatic way, allowing me to treat my body with respect.
**The Energy Bank Account**
While I was taking the CFIDS & FM self-help course, I learned about pacing to avoid flares. I decided to apply pacing to myself by creating what I called My Energy Bank Account.
I began by listing everything I do, from showering to eating an apple to having sex. Then I assigned a positive or negative number to each. Things like sleeping, daytime rests and prayer add to my energy and get positive numbers. Most of my activities reduce my energy and so get negative numbers.
Once I had assigned numbers, I used the plan like a check book, starting the day with the positive number provided by sleep and then deducting and adding with each action.
It turned out some of the negative numbers weren't high enough, which meant some things that I thought were not so taxing, are much more so. For example, I found that taking on the phone and taking out the garbage are more draining than I had thought.
Also, I found that every day is different and I have to adjust my numbers depending on such things as the weather and how people in my family are doing. I also learned to add extra points to an activity when I felt stressed.
I start the day by giving myself a number based on how well I have slept. If I get nine hours of good sleep, I give myself 90 points, which is a comfortable cushion above the level of 60, which I associate with a flare.
If I get fewer hours or my sleep is interrupted, I deduct points. By making this calculation every day for a while, I realized that I was on the verge of a flare at the start of any day when I had slept badly.
Recognizing the link between poor sleep and flares encouraged me to protect my sleep time. I began to prepare for bed earlier and to search for ways to maintain uninterrupted sleep during the night.
Also, I tried to work out a schedule in the morning to minimize my expended energy, by making my morning routine predictable. I did this by keeping my activity simple, by having easy breakfast foods available and by eliminating unnecessary activity.
Another discovery was finding that an activity might have a positive or negative number depending on circumstances. For example, yoga is usually positive, but can be negative sometimes, too. If I'm looking forward to it, and I have my pad and towel handy and there is a quiet place where I can go to relax, then yoga is great for me.
But if I can't do yoga until I've moved furniture, found my mat and towel and argued with someone about how loud the TV is, then it's a negative. I learned that if something positive turns to a negative, it's better not to do it.
Once I got my bank account up and running, and had used it for a month or so, I found that pacing was no longer something I had to think about unless I was doing something special, like taking a trip, going on vacation, or had been thrown into some unusual situation.
Unexpected situations call for extra measures such as using a timer to limit activities, taking time outs for a nap or some meditation.
**The Energy Savings Account**
I invented a new term to help me with special events: My Energy Savings Account. This is different from my regular Energy Bank Account, which I use to pace daily activities. The Savings Account is my way to store extra energy for special occasions.
Special events are much more draining than daily life, but I found I can make them more enjoyable if I make deposits in my Savings Account with naps and other positive activities in the days or weeks before the event.
I try to save up a hundred points a day for each day of the event. The higher my savings, the better chance I have of getting through the special event without a flare.
**A Bank Account Example**
To give you an idea of how the Energy Bank Account works, let me give you an example.
Let's say I got nine hours of sleep last night, but with some interruptions, so I start the day with 83 points. After doing my morning toilette (-5 points), helping my husband shave and dress (-6), getting breakfast (-4) and feeding the pets (-3), my balance would be down close the level of a flare.
It is time to make a deposit to build up the balance. Taking a rest or meditating for half an hour adds 15 points and puts me back up to around 80.
Then I might spend some time on the computer (-10 points), do the breakfast dishes (-4) and make lunch (-4). This brings my balance back near 60, so it's time for another deposit. I might spend some time alone reading for pleasure or use the time for prayer (+10).
After that, I would have another session on the computer, using 10 energy points and bringing me back to 60. (By the way, I use a kitchen timer to limit my computer time to twenty-five minutes per session, followed by at least five minutes of stretching.)
I then add lots of points to my balance by taking a long nap (+30). I might sleep for the whole time or sleep for part of the time and rest quietly for the remainder. A nap might be followed by more time on the computer (-10) and some time paying bills.
The "cost" for the latter depends on how stressed I'm feeling about the bills at the moment. If I am worried that the payment will be late, I double the energy cost (-15). Bill paying might be followed by yoga (+20) and making dinner (-10), leaving me with 75 points.
I like to write in the evenings. Writing is an enjoyable activity, but, because it involves brain work, is an energy drain (-10). And there is always the nighttime feeding ritual for the animals (-3). I also have to make sure my husband and I both take our evening meds (-2). Then it's time to make a big deposit by going to bed for the night.
**In Conclusion**
Using the Energy Bank Account to pace myself has helped me in several ways. Most importantly, it has given me permission to take care of myself. Previously, I had rarely told anyone no and tried to do everything I thought I was supposed to do.
Now I listen to my body and honor its limits. Remembering the cost of an activity, I can avoid overdoing. The reminder is especially useful for those things I want to do, where I can be tempted to forget the cost.
Also, by giving me a practical way to use the idea of pacing, it has enabled me to reduce my pain and fatigue and increase my sense of control and well being. All it took was pen and paper, and some thought. Balancing this checkbook is a lot easier and more enjoyable than the one I use to keep track of household finances. And in the long run, it's a lot more important.

# Third Time Is the Charm: How I Learned to Pace Myself | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Rosemary Rowlands, a CFS patient from the UK, has participated in the courses and groups of the CFIDS & Fibromyalgia Self-Help Program.*
I've had CFS for more than 20 years. My health declined gradually and was very poor by a few years ago. Since then, however, using pacing ideas from the self-help program and other sources, I've made steady progress and my life has improved greatly.
I now go out once or twice a day, rather than once or twice a week. I spend time socializing and doing enjoyable activities instead of using all my energy just taking care of my basic needs. My health is more stable and instead of often feeling helpless and hopeless, I feel much more in control.
**First Attempt at Pacing: A New Form of Push & Crash**
When I was forced to give up work, I thought I was pacing because I took a long rest every afternoon and had extra rest before major activities. In truth, my overall pattern wasn't much different from the push-crash cycle I had while working. I did as much as I could on good days and mainly rested on bad ones.
The results were discouraging. Instead of my health improving, the bad days seemed to get worse and more frequent. I never knew how I would feel or what I would be able to do from one hour to the next, and it was very stressful trying to make any plan or commitment
**Second Phase: Stability Through Alternating Activity and Rest**
Starting in early 2005, I took a new approach based on an article I read in the Action for ME journal. The author suggested alternating periods of activity and rest each day, and having a consistent activity level from day to day. After reading the article, I started to take planned rests throughout the day, lying down with my eyes closed.
Also, I stopped some activities that were very tiring or that couldn't fit into my new schedule. And I kept records every day to help me keep to the regime. These changes gave me more stability and I had far fewer bad days.
Unfortunately, I felt more tired and unwell than before. I was going to bed earlier and earlier at night because I felt so tired, and the quality of my sleep was very bad. Also, I was getting more back problems than I had previously and I had more depressive symptoms.
Looking back, I think that increasing rest resulted in increased deconditioning, affected my quality of sleep and disrupted my circadian rhythms ("biological clock").
At about this time, I took the self-help course, which provided me with some new ideas and reinforced familiar concepts. The class taught me the importance of having good sleep, the effects of sleep on pain and fatigue, the usefulness of record keeping, routine and schedules.
It also gave me a tool for achieving goals by taking a series of small, realistic steps, which the class calls "targets."
Over the following year I focussed on trying to have the same amount of activity and rest overall each day. I also worked towards sleeping less in the daytime, and experimented with different lengths of rest periods. These things helped me to have the confidence to move on to phase 3.
**Third Phase: Consistency Leads to Improvement**
In phase 2, I had stopped the push-crash cycle of doing a lot on good days and very little on bad ones. Now I wanted to develop a more consistent daily routine and reduce my tendency to push in the mornings and crash in the afternoons, moving towards a more normal rhythm to the day and gradually reducing rest. This new approach has paid off.
The strategies that have been most useful to me are: keeping records, making detailed daily and weekly schedules, resting frequently throughout the day, reducing daytime sleeping and spending less time in bed, being consistent in living by my schedule, and making changes gradually.
**Record Keeping and Planning**
To determine how much activity I should have, I kept records. I noted when I went to bed at night and when I got up in the morning. Throughout the day, I wrote down how long I spent on each period of activity, rest, sleep, etc.
To find a realistic schedule that I could repeat consistently, I divided the totals for two weeks by 14, which gave me an average of how much sleep, rest and light rest (reading/TV watching) I needed each day.
Then I made myself a timetable of activity and rest for the overall week, planning it in more detail, hour by hour, each evening for the following day, and I still do this. Initially, I used timers a lot, for activity as well as rest, to help me keep to my schedule. Nowadays, I mainly only use a timer to prevent me from sleeping too long when I rest during the day.
**Rest and Sleep**
Alternating periods of activity with time for rest is an important part of pacing. While at first I had rested for long periods when I felt especially tired, I found it more helpful to spread my rest periods evenly throughout the day, having several shorter periods rather than long times lying down.
During my rests, I do nothing, close my eyes and relax or occasionally nap. I also found that light reading or TV watching is a kind of rest for me and I use a combination of these activities with eyes-closed rest. As soon as I could manage my routine consistently, I reduced my total rest time.
I've also worked on normalising my sleep in ways I learned from the book Overcoming Chronic Fatigue by Mary Burgess. I decided to use my bed only for night-time sleep. (During the day, I rest in a reclining chair.)
I limited my time in bed to the hours my records show I needed to sleep. I tried to go to bed later in the evening, but always got up at the same time, regardless of how little sleep I had. Over time, I have gradually scheduled less time in bed at night.
In sum, I changed my daytime rest to consist of several scheduled short periods rather than resting in response to symptoms or for long periods of time. And I reduced daytime napping and instead focused on getting good quality sleep at night. I think that the combination of living by my routines and normalizing my sleep has helped reset my biological clock.
**Consistency and Gradual Changes**
I've found that consistency is also important. My aim is to have a routine which is, as much as possible, the same each day - meals at the same time, getting up and going to bed at the same time, etc.- with a variety of different activities, mental, physical, social, boring, enjoyable - throughout the day, interspersed with rest and relaxation.
I settled on living by a schedule after observing that my symptoms were made worse by chaotic routines and by resting for long periods of time. I found that what brought stability to my life was to be as consistent as possible, with similar amounts of activity each day and with resting little and often.
I still record my activities each day so that I can monitor my progress, and discover what works best for me. Once I find that I can manage a routine regularly I introduce small changes, perhaps decreasing my rest periods, spending less time in bed at night, or starting a new activity.
To do this, I plan targets for the week ahead on Sunday, and then review any problems that might have prevented me from achieving them the following Sunday. In this way I've managed to gradually increase how much I do each day and broaden the scope of my activities. Keeping records encourages me and reminds me how far I've come.
**The Payoffs**
Pacing has given me a way to make consistent, achievable changes in my life. I feel in control rather than always being driven by my symptoms. Using pacing over the last two years, I have increased my activity level by about 50% and I need less rest.
Some of my symptoms have improved: I have more stamina, less anxiety and depression, better sleep, and no back problems. Also, my tinnitus disappeared and I have less sensitivity to light and noise.
My sleep has improved and I now live my life on a schedule much closer to that of the rest of the world, which has made it much easier to schedule appointments and to socialise without moving outside my usual routines. Pacing makes my life and health much more stable. Stability has reduced my stress level substantially.
It took a lot of time and work to get to this point, but I've managed to stop and even reverse the trend of over twenty years of illness. My progress has given me a real sense of achievement and hope for the future.

# How I Use Routine to Successfully Manage Fibromyalgia | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Joan Buchman, a fibromyalgia patient from California, is a support group leader and has been a moderator for the CFIDS/ & Fibromyalgia Self-Help Program.*
During my time with fibromyalgia, I have found that having a routine lifestyle is crucial to moderating my muscle pain, optimizing my energy and enjoying my life with FMS.
I know that my daily patterns will sometimes be upset, but I have learned that if I am sensitive to my symptoms and willing to adjust my routines, I can have a full and happy life with fibromyalgia.
**Developing a Routine Lifestyle**
When my symptoms of FMS started in March 1991, I had no idea what was going on. It took 18 months to get a diagnosis. Only when my symptoms had a name, was I able to start learning about and come to terms with this illness.
Through reading about FMS, through a lot of trial and error, and by taking the CFIDS/FMS Self Help Course in 2000, I gradually learned that having a daily routine was the key to keeping my symptoms manageable. I also came to recognize that I have to adapt my routine from time to time to fit new circumstances.
This routine that I developed works well for me during stable periods of my life. This routine includes exercising three times a week doing aerobic exercise and weight training, taking a weekly tai chi class, walking three to four times a week, and resting once a day for at least one hour.
I have a social life which includes phone calls and outings with friends, and activities with my husband. I have time for my artistic hobbies of rubber stamping and calligraphy. By sticking to this routine, I maintain good symptom control and enjoy many satisfying activities.
I arrived at this routine by asking myself a number of questions. For example: What are my present pain and fatigue levels? What have I learned so far about minimizing these symptoms? Are my social interactions satisfying?
Am I allocating my time optimally to perform health maintenance, do home chores, have a family/social life, and engage in satisfying hobbies? The answers to these questions helped me arrive at the routine I described in the previous paragraph.
I have to remain open to making minor adjustments to my routine. For example, on a day when my pain is stronger, I may need to modify my exercise program.
Or if my fatigue during the day noticeably increases, I may rest for a longer period or go to bed earlier that night. Sometimes increases in my symptoms are just vagaries of the illness.
But from my many years of experience, I know that usually symptom increases are signals that I am off routine. Then I have to step back and see where I have deviated from my routine and decide what I need to do to get back on track. I may need to stop doing an activity altogether or simply pull back a bit.
**Life Changes Calling for a Completely New Routine**
Sometimes, I am pulled out of my routine by a one-time event, such as a family gathering. I make a choice to attend even though I know that I will be very tired when it is over and my other symptoms may increase. Since I make this decision consciously, I can plan down time afterward to re-establish my balance and get back to my routine.
But some life changes upset my routine in a more lasting way. Examples include leaving my job because of FMS, taking care of a terminally ill relative for six months, unexpected major surgery and moving four times in eight years.
Before I started this routine lifestyle plan, when one of these events occurred, I would resist my new reality and continue the changes in my life without making many adjustments. That added more stress to my life and worsened my symptoms.
After taking the CFIDS/FMS Self Help course, I learned that I needed to adjust my daily routine to cope with these events so I wouldn't have a total relapse of FMS.
The strategy I devised is to create a new routine out of my new situation as soon as possible. For example, when I had major surgery in 2002, my carefully crafted routine disintegrated. While recovering from the surgery, I had to drop all exercise except walking. For the next two months, I walked daily, working up from five minutes to 30 minutes at a time.
I was unable to do my other normal activities, because I was so weak. So my new routine became walking and resting. As I became stronger, I was able to gradually add back my other activities such as tai chi, going to see friends, catching up on correspondence, doing art, etc., eventually re-establishing my former routine.
Other times I have made a conscious choice that will cause a major change in my routine. An example of this is the many moves my husband and I have made in the last 12 years. Once we moved because of termites.
A year and a half later, we moved again to lower our monthly living expenses and establish residency for tax reasons. Then last year, we decided to move from Northern to Southern California to be closer to my family. These moves were all conscious choices to disrupt our lives.
When we decided to move over 500 miles to Southern California, I realized that this long-distance move would require a lot of planning and a long period of preparation, so I created a new routine.
Starting six months before our move date, I reduced my time with friends, still keeping in touch by phone, stopped doing my artwork and put that time into purging and packing. I continued with the exercise portion of my routine.
**The Value of Pacing**
My knowledge and experience with pacing was very helpful during this time. I found that I could pack four boxes a day and not be totally worn out, as long as my husband took those boxes out to the garage.
If I pushed those four boxes onto the hand truck and moved them to the garage, I was so worn out that the rest of the day I could do nothing else. I kept this "packing" routine going for several months. By the end of that time, we had sorted through our possessions, purged unneeded items and packed the rest.
After selling our house, we put most of our furniture into storage and moved to Southern California. We rented an apartment for three months while we found and purchased our ‘dream' retirement home. With all our belongings now at our new house, I have developed a new routine very similar to my old one, exercising, unpacking and creating a new life in our new town.
**Adjustment Is a Continual Process**
Even with all my years of adjusting to new situations that arise, managing FMS is a continuing learning process. Overall, the adjustment to our new home has gone well. My pain and fatigue levels have been manageable. But I developed sleep problems. I had trouble getting to sleep and woke up many times during the night. Looking at my routine, I realized that I was doing too much.
So my husband and I came to an agreement that we would pull back on the unpacking, giving me more time to relax and rest during the day. Almost as soon as I changed my routine, my sleep improved dramatically.
Now most nights, I fall asleep very quickly and only wake up once during the night, which was my pattern for many years. It was amazing to me how quickly and easily I was able to see improvement.
**Conclusion**
Some people may think that having a routine-driven life is boring, but for me it has been liberating. My illness is not running my life, I am. By being realistic about the illness and my symptoms, I am taking conscious steps to feel as well as I can.
There will always be unexpected events and situations in my life. But I feel confident that I will be able to change my daily living to cope with these changes and re-establish an equilibrium. This is key for me in living my best life with FMS.

# From Doing to Being: My Journey to Healing | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Yvonne Bond is a CFIDS, FM and IBS patient from New Mexico. A graduate of the CFIDS/Fibromyalgia Self-Help course, Yvonne is retired on disability from a museum job.*
I have had CFIDS, FM, and IBS since the late 1980's. For more than a decade, I lived with a dilemma: I thought I had to work, but trying to live a normal life made my condition worse.
Three years ago, I stopped working. Since then I have built a new and better life for myself. I'd like to tell you my story, which I call my journey from doing to being.
**A Life-Changing Sudden Onset**
I experienced a sudden onset of symptoms in 1987. While riding my bike to work one day, I became so dizzy that I couldn't hold my head up. For the next six months, I was so sick that I couldn't walk more than a few steps at a time. However, when a dream job opened up, I applied, thinking I had a virus that would soon wear off.
I did get the job, at an American Indian art museum, and for over twelve years I did my best, though I was often severely dizzy, weak, brain-fogged, and in severe pain. Eventually I was promoted to public relations director.
I kept pushing myself, thinking that if I slowed down, I was letting the illness win. Also, I felt that I needed to work to be a good model for my son. The treatments I tried helped enough to keep me going, but over the years I became progressively worse.
When I reflected on my situation, I had two conflicting thoughts. One was: "I'm too sick to work." The other was: "How can I live without an income?"
**The Turning Point**
A turning point occurred about 1998, when I took the CFIDS Self-Help course [since retitled to ME/CFS & Fibromyalgia Self-Help Introductory course]. When I looked at myself, I realized I was functioning at less than 50%, but living a life of 85% activity! That comparison showed me why I was getting worse.
I struggled with letting go of my job, which was my only source of income. Since I first got sick, I had been locked into the belief that somehow I could keep going. Then one day I woke up and said to myself: "I need to go on disability."
I had finally realized and accepted that I was too sick to work, not even one day a week. From that moment on, I concentrated all my remaining strength on leaving work. I went to doctors who could document my illness while I still had medical insurance.
Using the Disability Workbook for Social Security Applicants available from the CFIDS Association of America, I began working on my Social Security Disability application. I had the doctors' offices send me all my records.
A friend with CFIDS also gave me helpful information. I had enough savings to squeak by for about a year. At first it was difficult to get used to spending less money.
But gradually, as I let go of things-cable TV, magazine subscriptions-I found I didn't miss them. Internet support groups from this program provided me with regular opportunities to set targets and to "be my own scientist."
Logging, pre-emptive resting, pacing, and saying no became woven into my routine. So I survived the year and, thankfully, had received approval of my disability application.
**Creating a New Life**
I have made many adjustments to create a new life for myself. First, I decided that my new life would be centered at home. I started hosting small teacher-led meditation retreats. Friends decided to put out a donation basket for expenses.
I asked others for help with physical activities that tired me. When people come to help, I put out soup and sandwiches for them. The big room has become Open Heart Zendo, a meditation and meeting space.
My friends and neighbors in the small town where I live provide many kinds of support, such as rides to medical visits when I am too sick to drive. I am finding ways of connecting with others that don't take so much physical energy, that can take place here at my home base on a tree-lined residential street. In the process, I have learned to receive-something that is not always easy.
Open Heart Zendo is a place to relax, talk, sing, meditate, and have fun. It's really rooted in our neighborhood and in our town. Friendships are flourishing and I have a feeling of connection. One evening a month a poetry group meets, and a singing class is held every Tuesday.
I found that I love singing, and learning music is good exercise for my foggy brain. Getting an extra-long afternoon rest (one and a half to three hours lying down) is essential for me before evening activities. I've also found it helps not to schedule activities on two evenings in a row.
A favorable aspect of staying home most of the time is that there is ample creative time. I'm nurtured by silence and by getting back into the natural rhythms of sunrise and sunset, activity and rest.
Most days start with two hours of meditation, inspirational audiotapes and reading, a long warm bath, and stretching. Everything else can usually wait until after 11 or 11:30 a.m.
Dividing physical tasks into light, medium, and heavy has enabled me to do things I didn't think I could do. For example, I have found that if I plan my time carefully and switch among tasks of different types, I can have a garden.
My time in the garden might include five to 15 minutes of heavy work like digging, 15 minutes of light activity like taking out and putting away tools, and 15 minutes of a medium-difficult task like raking. I sit down in the sun in between tasks so I can just enjoy being outdoors.
With help from the Small Business Development Center, I started a home tape transcribing business a year ago. It's added a couple of hundred dollars a month --sometimes more-- to my shoestring finances.
Computer work tires me easily, so I have to pace myself during my two hours of daily work. I may get up to have a snack or play with the cat, and I take brief rests in which I lie down with my eyes closed. To keep my stress level low, I make sure my clients know that I don't do pressured work.
**Benefits of My New Life**
How am I doing after three years of being at home? My stress level is much lower. The difficult people are out of my life. My activity level is manageable. My moods are better.
Most important to me, my spiritual and creative life has really blossomed. I've learned to conserve energy and ask for help. Sometimes, though, I still overdo it (or eat the wrong food, et cetera) and pay the price, but usually I have chosen to do this.
I now believe that it would have been better to find an alternative to full-time work much sooner than I did. When I left work, I was 20 - 25 on the self-help program's Rating Scale, and felt really horrible all the time. I'm now 30 - 35 with occasional downturns. I still have flares and remissions, but I don't push and crash any more. I feel better. I know how to say no, and how to stop before I'm overtired.
In my new life, I focus on doing things that I love and that also bring happiness to others. I also base myself in being, not doing. That means resting, meditating, avoiding rushing and stress, accepting myself as I am. It means having lots of quiet time, down time, time to reflect, time to rest and renew.
"As soon as patients orient toward ‘being' and healing, interestingly, they are far better able to ‘do,' and I think far better able to heal and recover," says Dr. Paul Cheney, a leading CFIDS expert. That's pretty much what has happened with me.
I'm thankful for the love, patience, and inner strength that I've learned from living with a chronic illness. The path of responding to a sick body in a way that is wholesome continues taking me deeper into creativity, peace, and happiness.

# How I Created a Good Life with Fibromyalgia | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Joan Buchman, a fibromyalgia patient from California, is a support group leader and was a long-time moderator for the CFIDS/Fibromyalgia Self-Help Program.*
I have experienced many struggles in my eleven and a half years with fibromyalgia, but I have come to believe it is possible to live a happy, fulfilling life with chronic illness.
It takes discipline, determination, patience, the willingness to make lifestyle changes and a large dose of attitude adjustment, but I can honestly say that I am happier today than I was pre-FMS. It is a different life than I imagined I would have at this point. But it is a good life; I am at peace with my illness.
**Learning My Physical Limitations**
Now 57, I have had fibromyalgia since March 1991. My symptoms began with muscle pain in my legs and hips. Then I developed a sleep problem with resulting debilitating fatigue. Getting a diagnosis 18 months after my symptoms began brought relief, but also shock: How was I going to live for the rest of my life with this debilitating chronic illness?
During the early years, I went through a kind of death, the loss of the person I was before FMS. I began with denial. Early on, even after reading a lot about FMS, I continued my lifestyle of working, doing my share of the household chores, etc.
Since I had read that aerobic exercise was recommended for FMS, I started getting up at 4:30 am, so I could go walking before work. Of course, losing sleep made my fatigue even worse. I kept up this routine for five months before admitting that this strategy wasn't working. I quit my job, rested quite a bit and started exercising moderately.
I began looking for answers by learning as much as I could about FMS through books, magazine articles, health libraries, and a local FMS support group. I saw specialists in internal medicine, chiropractic, orthopedics, and rheumatology.
With their guidance, I spent six years trying many different treatments, both medical and complementary. I experienced temporary pain relief from acupuncture and massage therapy; nothing from two epidural injections.
Muscle, physical and massage therapy, tai chi, walking, aqua fitness and mild strength training all helped with body flexibility and muscle strength. Biofeedback taught me to relax, resulting in the most pain relief I had experienced so far.
To deal with the anger, despair and depression I was experiencing, I started therapy, which helped me come to terms with all the negative emotions I was having along with my FMS.
By 1997, my pain was moderate compared its level when I was first ill, but I hoped for more. Seeking to be pain free, I decided to explore mind/body medicine. I read books about the mind/body connection, relaxation and meditation. I regularly listened to meditation tapes by Emmett Miller, MD, Bernie Siegel, MD and others well known in this field.
I went to a trained hypnotist, which was very helpful. He made tapes of our sessions, which I continued to use after discontinuing treatment. By practicing the relaxation and meditation techniques, I lessened my pain further. Also, I began to relax and move more slowly in my everyday activities. The physical tension I had carried for so long was decreasing, allowing my body to relax.
At the same time, I was making lifestyle adjustments that also helped me control symptoms. I exercised regularly. I reduced my activity levels to use my available energy more wisely. I re-evaluated all my activities, cutting back or eliminating some, continuing others.
I incorporated resting into my daily schedule. I also learned that stress aggravates my physical symptoms. I identified stressors and devised ways to reduce or eliminate them.
**Attitude Adjustment**
By 1998 I had attained what I call conditional acceptance. It took me seven years to reach this stage. I found a good balance of activity, rest, exercise. I learned stress avoidance and stress reduction techniques. I evaluated my life in all areas and chose exercise, activities, relationships, and stress reduction techniques that supported my feeling as well as possible.
Based on my experience of having symptom reduction, rather than symptom erasure, I decided to focus on a coping strategy. I stopped treatments that did not erase my symptoms, which included acupuncture, medications, chiropractic.
This was a major change in my approach to living with FMS. I gave up on the miracle cure, deciding instead to focus on controlling symptoms and living the best life possible with a chronic illness.
**Reframing My Thoughts**
It became very clear that a positive attitude was crucial if I was going to attain acceptance and peace with my illness and my life. I finally learned that how I perceive myself and my chronic illness can greatly affect my quality of life. One way was by reframing my thoughts.
Reframing is a term used in psychology to mean learning to look at something from a new perspective. Taking a situation, and looking at it in a different way, can help one accept and embrace that situation and give it a positive spin.
I taught myself this skill. For example, I took the idea "I am so tired today. I don't think I will ever feel energetic again" and reframed it as "I am tired today. But from my past experience with fatigue, I know that I will feel good again, after giving my body the rest it needs."
The thought, "My pain is awful and it's never going to get better" became "Yes, the pain is strong today, but the last time it was this bad, it did get better."
**Inspiration From Others**
I gained a great deal of inspiration from my sister-in-law, who died of cancer at age 50. She lived with us the last five and one-half months of her life. She did not spend her time wishing for different circumstances. She spent it making peace with her situation.
She reached out to many people who had been part of her life. In return she experienced a remarkable outpouring of love. A wonderful example of someone who found peace of mind, she embodied Bernie Siegel's idea about love and healing: "Illness and death are not signs of failure; what is a failure is not living. Our goal is learning to live - joyously and lovingly."
Self-pity is a common experience with chronic illness. I took as a model of how to respond to it the ideas of actor/director Christopher Reeve, who was paralyzed from the shoulders down in a riding accident in 1995.
He wrote that he learned to replace saying, "What life do I have?" with "What life can I build?" I, too, realized that I could build a life that was happy and fulfilling if I set my mind to it.
I decided I needed to develop a hobby that could provide diversion from the health issues that were my primary focus. I rekindled a lifelong interest in arts and crafts and discovered various activities that I could do and still honor my limitations. I took drawing and calligraphy classes. I became very interested in rubber stamping and now make cards and other items to give and share with others.
I also learned that helping others with FMS reinforced my health routine while assisting others on this journey. I am a leader in my local FMS Support Group and also serve as a moderator for the CFIDS/Fibromyalgia Self-Help course.
**The Power of the Gratitude Journal**
By the end of 1998, I had achieved a level of acceptance that allowed me to have a reasonably happy life with FMS. Then I found something that brought me to a higher level of acceptance and in the process transformed my life: keeping a daily gratitude journal.
This is a simple exercise that anyone can do, writing each day five things to be grateful for. At first there were days when I struggled to find five things for which I was grateful. But the exercise had profound effects as I continued.
At first I expressed appreciation for people in my life and my life as it was. That led to feelings of gratitude for the lessons I had been learning about myself because of my illness. I learned that moving as fast as I could, doing as much as possible, was not making me happy. I was not taking any time to nurture my physical, mental or emotional needs.
As time went on, I came to believe that gratitude means appreciating what you have and making the most from that. Gratitude is not about "looking at the bright side" or denying the realities of life. Gratitude goes much deeper than that. It's about learning from a situation, taking the good to help deal with other challenges in the future.
It's about finding out that you have more power over your life than you previously imagined. You can stop being a victim of your circumstances and reach out to the joy in living. If you open your heart to the good in your life, gratitude becomes as much a part of your life as breathing.
In summary, focusing on the good in my life and putting these thoughts on paper each day for a year allowed me to see that I had much to be grateful for. And that I could have a good life with FMS. [For more Joan's experience with gratitude, see her article The Healing Power of Gratitude. - Editor]
**Making Peace For The Long Term**
From all the physical and mental modalities I tried over the years, I have developed a program of exercise, activity and rest that helps me feel as well as possible, giving me the best quality of life possible.
I do some type of exercise five days a week. I do activities that take no more than three hours at a time. I build formal resting into my day. My pain levels are stable, my sleep is better, and consequently my fatigue is under control.
Reframing my thoughts, finding inspiration from others' situations and writing the gratitude journal have helped me learn to focus on what I have. I also realized that I can focus on viable alternatives to activities I can no longer do in the same way as before.
Even though I can't do as much gardening now, I have learned how to simplify tasks, have found other ways of doing things, made my yard more low maintenance, found tools to help me, and limited myself to working very short periods of time.
I learned that I can find joy in everyday things - walking and seeing flowers and birds; the beauty of nature; spending time with family and friends, just enjoying their company, not necessarily "doing" something.
I also realized that I don't have to do it all. I can still enjoy traveling, even if I go at a slower pace. When possible, my husband and I arrange to stay in one place for several days so I don't have to pack up and move so often. I build resting time into the itinerary and don't try to see everything, as that's not possible even for a normal person!
Thanks to Dr. Richard Carlson's book Don't Sweat The Small Stuff!, I learned to lighten up and not take everything so seriously. He identifies 100 simple ways to keep the little things from taking over your life.
A few of my favorites: Make Peace with Imperfection; Remind Yourself that When You Die, Your "In Basket" Won't Be Empty; Think of What You Have Instead of What You Want.
**Benefits of Acceptance**
I have learned that there are many benefits of acceptance of my FMS. I take better care of myself. My health is a top priority. When I feel better, everything in my life works better. My life becomes more predictable, less of a roller coaster ride. With proper exercise, rest, and activity pacing, I am giving my body the gift of healing. My body relaxes when I'm not fighting with it, and I feel better.
I also have more confidence in myself and in dealing with people. By accepting my illness, I feel less of a need to explain, rationalize, and fret over what others think.
**A Major Test Of My Strategy**
I experienced a major test of my approach in June of this year when I was faced with major abdominal surgery. I felt the full physical impact of the surgery the first few days after. I had a lot of pain, which was moderated by medication. Food tasted terrible, due to the anesthetic drugs that were used. The hospital environment was loud and my roommate had many visitors.
I was extremely weak, but couldn't walk because of nausea from the drugs. Six days after the surgery, I went home to an environment much more conducive to healing. While convalescing at home,
I was able to bring up my reframing technique and begin the process of seeing the surgery in less of a negative light. As I did that, my recovery-anxiety decreased dramatically. I think this was a pivotal point in my recovery.
I gained strength quickly, which surprised both me and my doctors. I did not have a major FMS relapse after the surgery. Nor did I have the emotional upheaval I would have expected from having a serious medical problem and recognizing that there were risks with surgery. My rheumatologist credits my remarkable recovery to my positive attitude toward life and FMS.
**In Conclusion**
My experiences showed me that while I did not choose to have fibromyalgia, I do have a choice about how I live with it. I am grateful for the perseverance it took to "reframe" my attitudes about life with FMS. Doing so has enabled me to find joy in living with a chronic illness.
I still have pain and fatigue in varying degrees. But through grieving my losses and then focusing on my many blessings, I have achieved peace and a quality of life I couldn't have imagined when I first felt ill.
I agree with actor Michael Fox's sentiments about his life after receiving a diagnosis of Parkinson's: "What he [the doctor] did not tell me - what no one could - is that these last ten years of coming to terms with my disease would turn out to be the best ten years of my life - not in spite of my illness, but because of it."

# What Recovery Means to Me | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Before becoming disabled with CFIDS, JoWynn Johns had developed a management consulting business following 25 years as a corporate executive. She is a graduate of the CFIDS and Fibromyalgia Self-Help course.*
If recovery means returning to the way of life I had before CFS, I have not recovered. But in other and to me equally significant ways, I have recovered.
I am very much better and much more functional than I was three years ago and for about five years before that. Even though I still have important limits, I have recovered control over my life that CFS had taken away. Also, I have regained physical comfort and freedom from constant, distressing symptoms.
And I can once again engage in meaningful work. Living as I do, I feel good almost every day. So, I apply the word "recovery" to myself because I have regained a satisfying life. It's just not the life I had before CFS.
**Breakdown and Withdrawal**
When I was breaking down with CFS ten years ago, without a clue as to what was wrong with me, I reluctantly acknowledged that the parts of my life I most enjoyed seemed to be making me sick.
Doing the work I loved, having grandchildren stay with us, entertaining friends and family, eating in restaurants, going to the library -all made me feel terrible. How could this be, that what I liked doing was somehow connected with all the distressing symptoms and intolerable fatigue I was experiencing?
Until I had physically collapsed, unable to function at all, I refused to stop doing all these things. Unwilling to give up my satisfying life and not able to believe that it was indeed affecting me in this way, I made myself sicker and sicker. Finally, I was forced to stop working and everything else.
Without a diagnosis or any medical help, I hoped that if I just withdrew from the world for a while and rested I would recover. I wanted to return to the life I had been living, and I thought I could do so by taking a break. I expected that a few months of rest and relaxation-since my doctors could find nothing wrong with me-would restore me to my active, busy life.
Instead, for several years I lived mostly in seclusion, constantly seeking to understand what was wrong with me, trying any remedies or treatments that seemed to offer hope of curing what ailed me, always hoping that I could return to a fully active, productive life. But gradually my objectives changed. After feeling miserable for such a long time, I decided my goal should be just to feel better.
Gradually, I came to accept the idea that perhaps I never could go back to my old life. I began to let go of my goal of recovery as I had understood it, and to replace it with the idea of restoring quality of life through building a different kind of life than the one I had known before CFS.
**Beginning to Recover**
I didn't give up hope. I didn't resign myself to a life of suffering. I believed that I could find a way to live happily and relatively comfortably, and that is what I redirected my efforts toward discovering. As I let go of the need to get well and the repeated attempts to get my old life back, I finally began to recover.
Subsequently, I found a naturopathic treatment that has produced considerable improvement in my condition, but I am still not able to return to work as a management consultant or take my grandchildren on trips.
However, from being able to function only at about 30% of my previous lifestyle for most of the past ten years, I am now functioning at about 70%. This is a big improvement, and I may continue to improve, but recovery has come to have a different meaning for me.
**Regaining a good life**
Though I am living a limited life as compared with my pre-CFS life, CFS no longer controls me. I am controlling my CFS. I have recovered control over my life. In contrast to my years of isolation, I am now able to visit, shop, and engage in other activities selectively and moderately.
I choose to live this way so that I can be free of debilitating symptoms and able to do meaningful work-creating needleart, for several hours every day. This is very important to me. While it is not the life I once had, I have recovered a satisfying life, a 100% enjoyable life. The word "recovery" means to regain or restore, and I have recovered a high quality of life.
As a diabetic must manage her diet and monitor her intake of certain foods in order to control blood sugar, I must manage my activities and monitor my energy level so as to limit the demands on my dysfunctional neurohormonal system.
I have voluntarily given up the idea that a satisfying life must be the active life I once enjoyed and replaced it with an alternative way of life-simpler, slower, quieter-that is equally satisfying.
**Realistic Expectations Make the Difference**
These changes have not come easily or quickly. Living with CFS is challenging. It is hard work! But I have found that it is possible to manage my life so that I feel good most of the time. By giving up the need to have what I used to have, by giving up the idea of recovery as return to a past way of living, I have created a good life. This is my recovery.
While some CFS patients experience full recovery, able to resume full-time work and to do all they were previously able to do, most do not. I believe that if the majority are able to adjust their expectations realistically and minimize their attachment to a particular goal -which means choosing a different way of life- they too may recover the quality of life that CFS steals from us.

# Coming to Terms with a Life I Did Not Plan | Treating CFS & FM

|
Normally, the thought of overcoming obstacles is not abhorrent to me. In fact, I usually enjoy it. In my pre-CFIDS life as a newspaper editor, obstacles to getting the story were a simple fact of life. I did whatever was necessary - work overtime, spend money or resources, try a different game plan - and something I tried almost always worked.
**The Challenge of CFIDS**
But with CFIDS, I found myself with something I could not "work" around. I couldn't pretend CFIDS wasn't there. I couldn't shed it like an old skin. I couldn't even work harder to overcome it. In fact, working harder is exactly what I shouldn't be doing.
Which is why this thing is impossible to "overcome." I found myself searching desperately instead for a way to live with this illness. How do you learn to live with something that robs you of everything you hold dear?
How do you reconcile yourself to a life you didn't plan? The answer is: it ain't easy, my friend. There is no shortcut to acceptance. Each of us has to do this the hard way.
I went through the just-realized-this-isn't-going-away stage. Before that, I was at the I'll-be-back-to-work-in-no-time phase. I think I'm headed into the Godallmighty-I'm-mad phase, followed by the guess-I'll-live-with-it-after-all phase. This follows Elizabeth Kubler-Ross' four-stage process of grieving quite nicely - denial, bargaining, anger, acceptance.
And we do each have to go through a grieving process for what we've lost because of CFIDS: our jobs, our healthy selves, our dreams of what we thought our lives would be.
We have to mourn our losses before we can fully accept the limitations CFIDS places on us. I think I've finally figured out that emotional milestones are not easily won. You proceed through the process a little bruised, a little unsure of yourself.
My personal battle has had two separate parts. First, my rational self began the process of realizing that CFIDS had changed my life irrevocably. That self fired off letters to senators, wrote columns about CFIDS and dutifully took her medicine every day.
That self spent countless hours educating herself about CFIDS. That self can calmly recognize when she's done too much and when she needs to rest. That self doesn't deal in wishes and dreams and what-ifs.
But my child-like, emotional self was another thing entirely. She spent months alternately denying, pouting, screaming silently and making a nuisance of herself. She couldn't seem to get it through her head that she was no longer who she was before CFIDS and that everything is different now.
She kept stomping her foot and demanding to know why we can't go back to our old life, which we liked just fine, thank you very much. Worst of all, she couldn't answer the question: Now what?
So I figured out this much: To go on with my life, I needed the answer to that question.
And since I had already spent several months "stuck" in this phase of struggling to accept CFIDS, I decided that I needed some counseling to help me sort out that answer. I needed someone to help me understand how I could carve out a life that I want to live despite this illness.
That was not an easy admission to make. I would have liked to be able to "handle this" by myself. But a few brief sessions (three actually) with a psychologist helped me understand which issues were a problem for me, which in turn made it easier to deal with me.
For me, the most valuable thing about seeing a counselor was what led up to it. I had to think long and hard about what I would say once I got there. Thinking about how to articulate the problem made me ask myself some tough questions:
- How do I feel about CFIDS and its effects on my life?
- Am I angry?
- Sad?
- Has CFIDS ruined my life?
- Am I handling this badly?
- Do I try to "tough it out" too often?
- Why does it matter so much to me that this illness be "legitimized?"
- What have I done so far to come to terms with this illness?
- What if I'm like this for the rest of my life?
- How has this illness affected the people I care about and their relationship with me?
**What I Learned**
The valuable lessons I learned in counseling weren't earth-shattering. Most of what helped was the realization that all of the important stuff in my life was still there.
Despite CFIDS, the things that are important to me - my relationship with my husband, kids, and family, and my ability to contribute something to the world - are still satisfying. Despite CFIDS, I am a relatively happy person. I've decided CFIDS hasn't "ruined" my life so much as changed it profoundly.
I learned very quickly that I was sometimes my own worst enemy. For instance, I was overly concerned and terribly unhappy about the weight gain CFIDS meant for me.
Since exercise makes me relapse, and I eat a relatively healthy diet, my counselor helped me realize that there's little I can do to change my weight. It's simply something I will have to adjust to. So now I try to remind myself often that I'm not a bad person just because I'm chubbier than I used to be.
I was also berating myself and feeling guilty about all the things I could no longer do routinely - cook, clean up, enjoy hobbies or sports or fun outings. I worried that my husband was getting the end of a very pointy stick - wasn't I a drag? Wasn't he sick of doing all the work? Didn't he wish he had a healthy wife? How awful is this for him?
When my husband and I talked about these issues, he pointed out something very valuable to me: If the situation were reversed, would I still love him, he asked. Of course, I said, stung he'd even asked the question. Then I realized: I was assuming the worst of him when I assumed he'd love me less because I'm sick.
Then we talked about what bothered him most about my being sick and his responses surprised me - an always-messy house, a lousy social life and my tendency to overdo and then relapse. Now we simply look for things to do that aren't tiring, like movies, going to museums (we bring the wheelchair for me) and going for long drives together.
We got a cleaning service to come in every other week, making the house livable again. And I vowed to work on resting and not overdoing it. It's made a small but significant difference. We feel like we're "handling" it.
And, hey, life isn't so bad! The best part: I don't think often about this stuff anymore.

## detail-80-Getting-Through-the-Bad-Days.html

# Getting Through the Bad Days | Treating CFS & FM

|
Like many CFIDS patients, my emotions go up and down along with my symptoms. I've had times when I've been at the top of my personal health curve, working fulltime and feeling good.
I've also been bedridden, the low end of my curve. I've been everywhere in-between, too.
Along with the physical roller-coaster ride, my emotions have traveled some peaks and valleys. That's been tough on me and on those around me.
But I learned some lessons during my relapses, so I won't be caught off guard by them in the future. Even though I have a disease which humbles and humiliates me, I've got an arsenal of patience and persistence. Patience means that on my sickest days, I have to force myself to believe that this, too, shall pass.
I know sometimes that's not easy. I have lain in my bed and despaired that I would ever get out of it again. In spite of those really horrible days, I try very hard to limit self-pity and to employ a matter-of-factness that seems to lessen those days' impact on my overall well-being.
Nowadays, if I have a really bad day, when my husband comes home, I simply tell him I had a bad day. I don't dwell on it. I don't bug him for hours with talk of the ‘what ifs' (What if this is another relapse? What if I'll be like this for the rest of my life? What if you catch this? What if we run out of money?)
Most of all, I don't let myself think of me as that person stuck in bed. She's me alright, but she's not the best of me. She's just a part of who I am. So was the ‘well' me. One isn't better or worse, it all just is. What I've got is some bad days, some middle-of-the-road days and some good days. Who doesn't?
**Lessons from the Bad Days**
I've learned a few things that helped get me through those bad days. Maybe they'll help you, too.
**Plan for the Bad Days **
I plan for a bad day by imagining it as a day off from work. (I am working on recuperating, after all.) Just like I did when I was well and I had a day off but it was raining outside, I curl up in front of a fire and read a good book. I take naps. I try not to feel guilty that I'm basically doing nothing. (That's what I'm supposed to be doing, I'm sick!).
I have things put aside for my bad days, like very easy puzzle books, some trashy magazines and some crafts I like to do. I write the occasional letter to a friend or call someone else with CFIDS so we can commiserate together. I watch Oprah, eat simple, healthy things I can grab right out of the frig or cabinet. In other words, I give myself permission to take it easy.
**Allow an Occasional Bout of Private Self-Pity **
On my absolute worst-of-all-days, I allow myself a short period of time to really get into feeling sorry for myself. I cry. I wail. I hold my dog and wonder if this is all worth it. I get very angry. I think about all the useful, fun things I could be doing with my life.
Even though I don't actually believe it for a minute, I even imagine that if I weren't sick I'd be everything I'd hoped I'd be (thin, beautiful, successful, etc.).
Then I let it all go. There isn't much point staying in that mood for more than a few hours. I don't share those moods with anyone anymore. They're mine and I use them to diffuse the worst effects of this disease on my life. I'm persistent in believing that my life is still worth something. I'm still worth something.
**Believe in the Good Days, Too **
No matter how severe the relapse, I remember the better days and realize that I will have some of those again soon. And even during a relapse, I have occasional good days. I make the best use of those as well.
**Use the 50-Percent Solution **
I've learned not to squander the little energy I have. On a good day, I try to do about 50-60 percent of whatever I can manage. It is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. It's difficult to learn the intricate way your body tells you when to rest and when to do. I've found I have to play it by ear and pay attention to what my physical and mental needs are. Persistence pays off.
**Just Do a Little **
On those days when I felt lucid and mildly energetic, there were so many things I hadn't been able to do that I wanted to do that I tended to crowd too much in. Naturally, the next day or so, I paid for it with increased needs for bed rest. Once the pattern emerged, I slowed down. Now I allow myself to just do a little. Then I lay low for a few hours.
**Schedule Time for Rest **
Even on a good day, I schedule time for rest each day. It's a fact I hate but have been forced to heed.
**My Bottom Line**
Just because I'm sick doesn't mean I can't have a nice life. Okay, so I probably won't get my old life back, but I can make a new one. I don't dwell much on what I can't do. Instead, I spend time trying to figure out how I can be happy doing what I can do.
The bottom line: life is not a dress rehearsal. This is my life, and it's the only one I'll ever have. CFIDS or not, I don't intend to forget to live it.

# Adjusting to Food Allergies and Sensitivities | Treating CFS & FM

|
The few mild digestive problems I had before CFS were magnified when I became ill, but over time I have improved my digestion and this has had a big effect on the rest of my symptoms.
Pre-CFS, I was mildly lactose intolerant but now I can't eat any dairy at all. Also, I am hypoglycemic and have Irritable Bowel Syndrome [IBS] as well as many food sensitivities. I avoid dairy, wheat, refined sugar, nightshade vegetables (potatoes, tomatoes, peppers and eggplant), sulfites and preservatives.
To figure out all of the foods that didn't work for me I used an elimination diet. I cut out one suspected irritant at a time for a couple weeks each. Through logging I could see if my digestion was improving and if there was any effect on my symptoms.
It was only when my digestion began to improve that I understood how much of an effect it had on the rest of my symptoms. I've noticed an especially strong link between stomach problems and increased brain fog as well as low blood sugar and my NMH [Neurally Mediated Hypotension].
Because there are so many things I can't eat, buying ready made food or getting take out isn't really an option for me so I cook all of my meals. When I was at my sickest, cooking my dinner was the biggest task of my day. I quickly learned that trying to do all the cooking at once was too much for me. I would prep ingredients earlier in the day, then rest, then do the actual cooking, rest before and after eating and then clean up.
I cook mostly one pot meals for simplicity's sake. (Making a main dish and two sides with brain fog is a recipe for disaster.) I also try to make a meal with leftovers a few times a week so I can have dinner in the fridge or freezer if I have a busy day or just need a night off cooking.
It may seem tough but I've come to see cooking with limited choices as a daily chance to flex my creativity. Not being able to eat so many foods has led me to explore new foods and make some great discoveries (my latest find is celeriac). I've been forced to learn so much about cooking and nutrition and become a much better cook because of this experience, someone who actually enjoys cooking.

# Assertiveness: A Tool for Reducing Symptoms | Treating CFS & FM

|
We talk a lot in the self-help program about factors that intensify symptoms, things like the push/crash lifestyle, poor sleep, and stress. But one factor that often gets overlooked is lack of assertiveness. If we’re not able to stand up for ourselves and our needs, we’re likely to find it difficult to say “no” to demands that take us beyond our limits.
Unfortunately, being ill can make it difficult to be assertive. We may feel dependent on others or fear that we will be abandoned. But to protect our health, we need to communicate our limits to others in a way so that the limits are understood and accepted. In other words, to be assertive.
**Three Communication Styles**
Let me explain how to do that by contrasting assertiveness with two other styles of communication: being passive and being aggressive. After that, you’ll find an assertiveness success story.
**Passive **
In the passive style, people are hesitant to speak up for themselves and have difficulty expressing their feelings and opinions. They may feel that it is selfish to ask for what they need.
As a result, they may feel anxious, helpless and resentful because their needs are not being met. Sometimes grievances build up, leading to explosive outbursts. The outburst may lead to shame and guilt, which in turn leads back to being passive.
**Aggressive **
People using the aggressive style act in a way that is disrespectful of others. People who are aggressive often try to dominate and control others, using criticism and blame. They use intimidation to get their way. They are unlikely to use a phrase like “let’s have a win/win solution.”
**Assertive **
The assertive style, in contrast, is one in which a person states her feelings and positions clearly, and advocates for her rights and needs, while being respectful of others and their rights and needs. People who are assertive create an environment conducive to mutually-satisfying solutions.
**Assertiveness Success Story**
A person in our program, who I’ll call Mary, recently had a situation in which these communication styles played out. During a discussion on assertiveness, Mary, who has severe CFS, described a pattern of passivity and said she wanted to use the occasion of our discussion to learn about assertiveness and apply it to one relationship in her life.
The trigger was a visit Mary had from a friend named John. He stayed for six hours, way more than Mary’s body could tolerate. Because John had driven an hour to get to her house and fixed lunch, Mary was reluctant to end the visit when her body starting crying out for rest.
An irony in the situation is that he has made equally-long visits weekly for more than a decade, so there was a long-term pattern of passivity. Mary reported that the visits had been using up all her energy for the day of the visit and also some of the energy required for the following two or three days, meaning that she began each week in an energy hole.
The price of this particular visit, in combination with the discussion in our group gave her the motivation to work on restructuring their time together.
She told the group that the visits had been very important to her and she views the friendship as very special. She wrote: “I have been largely housebound for a long time and a lot of people have drifted away, but [John] has remained a loyal and understanding friend.”
She said it was tempting to say “your visits are too costly and I wish you weren’t so terribly negative sometimes because it drags me down.” But she dismissed this aggressive statement, saying her goal was to find a new way to spend time with her friend that “maintains the friendship and respects his needs and feelings, but which doesn't knock me around.”
In sum, she had a long-term pattern of *passivity*, which had been costly to her and a temptation to be *aggressive* in response, but a goal of being *assertive*.** **
**Finding a Solution**
Although initially she was not clear about how to proceed, she knew that she wanted to find a way to explain to her friend that the visits were costing her too much. She also wanted to think about what alternative would work for her and believed it would probably involve an earlier start, a shorter visit, and her taking one or two rest breaks during their time together.
She asked for suggestions from the group and was particularly grateful for one of them, a model of assertive communication. It stated Mary’s views, was factual and respectful of John, did not blame him for the relapse and invited him to work with her to find a solution.
*John, your visits have been incredibly important to me and your friendship is very special. I have been housebound for a long time and a lot of people have drifted away, but you have remained a loyal and understanding friend and I can't tell you how much that means to me. *
But right now I am in a relapse and I hate it that physically I just can't handle a five hour solid visit, much as I would like to and as much as I appreciate your coming.
*I have been reluctant to bring this up because I am scared of hurting you or losing your friendship. Can we brainstorm together and come up with some ideas where we could enjoy each other's company, but in a way that it doesn't make me feel worse?*
**The Outcome**
Mary reported back to the group a week later, in an email titled “Assertiveness: I did it!” She said she had a discussion with John, and began by telling him how much his friendship and loyalty meant to her and how much she had enjoyed their times together.
Then she added that the visits had been using up all her energy for the day of the visit and beyond. She added that she wanted to discuss how to change the visits so she could stay within her limits.
Working together, they came up with a plan to break the visit into two parts with a 1 1/2 hour break in the middle, where John reads the Sunday paper and she retires for a rest. In addition, Mary would take two 15 minute breaks.
Mary told the group that the experience had been “life changing. I am now fully set up for living within my limits and therefore improving my health, and I have experienced how gentle, caring and cooperative assertiveness can be.”
Reporting back to the group a year later, she said that the visits had worked out as planned. |

# Dancing with the CFIDS Dragon | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Beatrice M. Desper, an American living in Paris, is a moderator for the CFIDS and Fibromyalgia Self-Help Program.*
CFIDS struck me at age 21. Within a few weeks, I was turned from a college student who regularly swam three miles a day into someone functioning at 10% of normal. Over the following ten years, I recovered back to 50% and beyond, where I am today, 25 years after the onset of my illness.
I attribute my improvement to a combination of pacing, graded exercise and support. Here are some of my strategies.
**Pacing**
Even though my fatigue and brain fog started in spring, I didn't drop out of school until the fall. Then I was able to let my body get the rest it needed. I set a few priorities: rest, food, some social interaction and medical attention.
Having short activity periods tops the list of pacing strategies. For example, in the first weeks of my convalescence, eating meals exhausted me. I prepared simple breakfasts and lunches, and then went back to bed.
The diabetic friend who took me in made me dinners, thank goodness. Taking showers exhausted me so I took them once every two days. Leaving the house for any reason exhausted me, so I stayed inside, sometimes for several weeks, to recuperate.
From 1989 onward, I kept extensive records of what I did, how I felt, and what I ate to find correlations. I tried to find my limits and remain within them. For example, I was sensitive to soy, corn and eggs, so I limited them. I also noticed that symptoms increased during the allergy seasons, so I had to allow for extra rest during them.
By September 1989, I was able to live on my own, but it was difficult. I did laundry once a week and nothing else that day. Standing to cook wore me out and hurt my thighs, so I sat at a table.
I prepared dinner two to three times a week and ate the leftovers the following days. Vacuuming, mopping or heavy housework would have put me in a severe relapse, so I just didn't do it. And I took three "naps" or down times per day, whatever my symptoms.
From 1989-1994, the time I spent in daytime resting and nighttime sleeping decreased from 15 hours a day to 12.
Nowadays, I teach English a couple of hours a week. Most days, I can read, write or work on the computer for up to three hours. However, I have to limit these sessions of concentration to less than one hour each.
I still do laundry once a week. I shop twice a week, get groceries delivered, and make it into the city once a week by metro and a second time by car. Finally, although I can get through many days without an afternoon rest, I do much better if I lie down and forget the world for twenty minutes.
**Graded Exercise**
When I say graded, I mean very small steps. At first, it was not even baby steps, but nano steps. For the first few months of my convalescence, getting dressed and taking a shower were my only exercises. When I lived on my own, walking around the grocery store was my exercise. I took the shortest route possible around the store and parked in handicapped spots.
When I moved to Paris, I took up yoga. But, when I discovered that many yoga poses trigger migraines, I switched to gentle gym. I keep my pulse below an anaerobic level and try to keep my joints mobile as I age.
[Note: For an explanation of anaerobic threshold and exercise, see the article [Pacing By Numbers: Using Your Heart Rate to Stay Inside the Energy Envelope](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/library/pacing-numbers-using-your-heart-rate-to-stay-inside-energy-envelope) on the self-help program website.]
When my town pool re-opens in a few months, I hope to resume some gentle swimming. Since I fell ill, I have never been able to do anything aerobic for more than ten minutes, so I still have to be careful to avoid overdoing. I wish I could do more, but I'll take what I've got.
**Three Kinds of Support **
My improvement was helped greatly by three kinds of support: from family and friends, from therapists and from doctors.
**Family and Friends **
I never would have made it as far as I did without the support of the man who was my boyfriend when I got sick and is now my husband. The support of my family and a diabetic friend were also critical.
For years my future husband visited me when he could and telephoned every day. His confidence in my potential for improvement was very reassuring. Even when I was too sick to read the TV Guide, he told me I'd go back to school one day, which I did.
At first my mother didn't "get it," but after I lent her a book on CFIDS, she was more sensitive. Thanks to her, I was especially lucky in that I never was under any real financial pressure.
The diabetic friend who took me under her wing for two years taught me how to dance with the dragon called exhaustion. I call it a dragon because if I tried to ignore it, it wreaked its vengeance on me, not with fire, but with the intensification of symptoms called Post-Exertional Malaise.
Over time, I was able to tame it by learning to stop comparing myself with my healthy self, but to accept my limits, discover what made my exhaustion worse, and hope for improvement in the future. This was difficult because I wanted instant improvement.
Therapy
I don't believe CFIDS is depression, but I sure think having it can cause depression. I agree with the results of a psychological test I took early on in my illness. They said I suffered from "a physical illness of unknown origin with secondary depression." In that case, "secondary" means "as a consequence of a physical illness."
The therapist showed me that what was obvious to me, my exhaustion and all the other odd symptoms, were NOT obvious to my family and friends. I was making assumptions that I shouldn't have.
She taught me communication techniques. She believed I was sick and, by that, validated my illness. She also encouraged me to write. I have a half a dozen full notebooks of my diaries from those dark days.
When I moved to Paris and finished school in 1998, I realized that the French economy had little, if anything, to offer me. Frustrated and blue, I started to take anti-depressants. If this were a perfect world, I wouldn't take them. If this were a perfect world, I wouldn't have CFIDS! If medication lowers my good moods, it raises my low moods. Overall, it raises the quality of life.
**Doctors**
I was sick for about two years before I really figured out how to work with a doctor. I was lucky enough to be treated for some time by a homeopathic doctor, who checked me for food allergies. By careful record keeping, we discovered that I was sensitive to soy, corn and wheat.
But his homeopathic remedies didn't have the effects I wanted, so I switched to Dr. Susan Levine in New York City. I gave her written copies of my health diary, which showed how long each of my relapses had lasted and what the major symptoms were. She helped me to apply for Social Security Disability.
I went through the whole disability process again five years later. At the time I was a half-time student. I explained my limitations to my doctor and to Social Security, who extended my benefits. For both applications to Social Security, I couldn't possibly cover all the relevant information during one office visit.
For the first application, a friend typed up my notes. For the second one, I typed them myself. My doctor was thus able to paint the complete picture of my situation.
**In Conclusion **
If you are looking for a fairy tale ending, you won't find one here. Since CFIDS is a chronic illness, I struggle with cycles of denial, acceptance, bargaining, etc. Furthermore, in the past few years, I've come to realize that having a chronic illness doesn't prevent one from having to deal with the aches and pains associated with aging.
However, through pacing, resting, and getting help from my family, therapists, and doctors, I've found stability in my life. When I dance with the CFIDS dragon, I don't step on its feet nearly as often.

# Exercising Safely Using Nano Steps | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Margo, who lives in Missouri, is an active participant in the CFIDS & Fibromyalgia Self-Help Program.*
I have tried many exercise schemes in my two and a half years with CFS, failing miserably at all of them until quite recently. But I finally found something which works for me; I call it the Nano Steps Approach to Exercise.
Let me tell you about it, beginning with my failures.
## Failed Experiments
The first exercise regime I tried was interval walking: walk 3 minutes, rest 3 minutes. The result was a spectacular crash, which took a couple of weeks to get over. Even using shorter time intervals didn't work.
Then I tried strength training using exercises geared toward elderly people with osteoporosis. I made good progress at first, but when I got to five repetitions, I crashed. Discouraged, I was reluctant to try again.
Next, I tried "baby steps." I made a list of every sub-step it took to accomplish a goal, and then each day or two I would attempt to do one more step towards the goal. I quickly realized what I thought were baby steps were in fact too much for me. Frustrated, I stopped.
Finally, I tried heart rate monitoring but found that although I felt a bit better, I was losing stamina and still crashing. I discovered I did better going on instinct rather than by the numbers.
What I learned from this experience was that the duration of an activity is just as important as heart rate in my avoiding a crash. (I realized only later that this could explain a lot of the trouble I had had with earlier exercise/activity programs.)
## A Model
Late last year, I found myself in a terrifying relapse where I was suddenly living on the first floor of my house, unable to use the steps to either the basement or the upstairs, and using my scooter to get around the downstairs. I knew I **had** to find something to go forward rather than backward.
About that time, I read an article by [Dianne Timbers](http://www.cfids.org/cfidslink/2009/090207.pdf), a woman with CFS who had gone from almost completely bedridden to living independently. The secret to her progress was to make tiny incremental changes over long periods of time, starting with activity she could tolerate on her worst days.
Her approach appealed to me because I had always had trouble deciding if it was a good enough day to attempt exercise.
I was in awe of what she had accomplished, at her persistence, and her patience, grit and tenacity. The instant-gratification part of me was a bit horrified that it took her a number of years to reach her goal, but still, I was intrigued and inspired.
## Creation of the Nano Steps Program
I decided to try an approach based on two principles:
- Start with something you can do even on your worst day.
- Remember: no step is too small.
Since my baby steps were clearly too big, I decided to call my approach "nano steps."
My first goal was to increase my walking stamina, which was then about 10 steps. (Anything more risked a crash.)
I started by driving my scooter between my couch and the kitchen/bathroom area, about 25 feet away. Each day I would park the scooter about six inches further back toward the couch. It worked: I was walking further and not crashing. Seeing progress gave me the motivation to keep going.
I sometimes noticed a you-need-to-stop-right-now sensation just as I was completing my walk. I knew from experience that this sensation, if ignored, would likely result in a crash.
Since I knew that the key to expanding exercise safely with CFS is to be active at the edge of your abilities, I decided I was doing exactly the right thing! And, after several weeks, I was able to walk the entire distance from the couch to the kitchen/bathroom and back.
(I should note that on bad days, I gave myself permission to stay at the same distance as the day before. Also, I think one time I did go forward a couple of feet when I was having a really bad day. And I won't deny cheating a time or two and driving all the way!)
**Further Experiments **
Since I still didn't have enough stamina to walk around the house as I pleased, I decided to continue the same process by taking a circuitous route around the house, about 40 feet. As my stamina got better, I found I could increase the length of my steps from six inches to 12 or 18 inches.
Once I could walk those 40 feet, I started on my next goal: the stairs. The first day I went up one step and back down, three times during the day. The next day I went up and down two steps three different times during the day. The day after that, it was three steps, etc.
There were a couple of times where I had to pause, as with the walking. One time, when I had worked my way about halfway up, I had an unrelated crash and felt it was safest to start over. But soon enough, I made it to the top of the stairs and back. I was ecstatic. My little world had just expanded by about 1000 square feet!
My next goal was to walk across my backyard to the car, a distance of about 40 feet with a downhill slope to the carport, thus uphill back to the house. I figured that since I could walk 40 feet, and I could do steps, I should be able to walk to the carport and back. Feeling overconfident, I turned my nano steps into five to eight foot increments.
Although I did make it out to the car twice, it became clear I was pushing too hard. I was too fatigued to do the nano steps every day, and there was too much else going on right then: a number of trips out of the house and other stressful events.
I was struggling to keep up, so I suspended my efforts to expand my activity level. But now I have "cleared the decks," so am in a good position to return to my nano program.
**Summing Up**
In thinking back to where I was at the end of last year, I definitely feel a big difference. My stamina is better. I can stand longer without having to grab a chair. And I need less help. (During that scary relapse, I hired a friend to help me a few hours a week with shopping, errands, laundry, etc. I recently cut her visits from two per week to one.)
I keep a chart with a 0 to 100 scale, marking it each week with a dot. I was gratified to see that when I was actively nano-stepping, the dots went higher five weeks in a row - the first time that has *ever* happened! And the scooter now is "garaged" permanently in the back of my car, for use on trips out of the house.
I still have a long way to go to reverse a lot of deconditioning, and I still struggle with impatience getting the better of the evidence that small steps are best, but I am just immensely relieved to have finally found a way to expand my activity level safely. And I'm looking forward to lots more of those upward-trending dots.

# Learning to Manage Stress | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Before retiring, Margaret was the principal of a high-poverty urban elementary school. She has been a member of our program since 2011, Co-Executive Director of our program since 2016, and moderator of our Living Your Plan groups since 2014.*
Before CFS, I thrived on stressful situations. I was at my best when things were in chaos and needed "fixing," but my ability to cope with any stress at all became a significant problem for me when I came down with CFS. With lots of work, however, I have developed a set of strategies that help me manage stress.
**Effects of CFS on Stress**
My last professional position before becoming ill was as principal of a high-poverty urban elementary school, a position I requested because the school was beset with out-of-control behavior and low achievement.
So I was shocked at my inability to cope with even the tiniest bit of stress when I got CFS. I seemed to have no control over the adrenaline surges. And my startle response is so goofy that I jump at things that I would not have even noticed before.
I used to love change, but now new situations just heighten my anxiety. Something as simple as the first session of a watercolor class set my heart pounding. You would have thought I was about to rappel down a cliff.
The same with unexpected changes in schedule. If a friend called to ask us over for dinner at the last minute and it was not in my plan for that day, it sent me into a tizzy. And all I had to do was show up on time and eat. How hard is that?
**Weird Symptoms**
Something else that created stress was an array of weird symptoms that included double vision, chest tightness and dizziness. Having rarely had anything more than a cold or seasonal allergies before CFS this was very stress-inducing for me. One of my early questions after being diagnosed with CFS was how to know when to call the doctor about my weird symptoms.
Over time, I developed some rules for handling these symptoms. The rules have helped me both address the symptoms and reduce the stress they cause. I have the really troubling and severe ones checked out by doctors when they appear.
For non-urgent symptoms, I follow a rule of thumb used by a friend: wait for a month, then see a doctor only if the symptom persists. (Some of my unexplained symptoms last a while, then disappear as suddenly as they started.) And, third, I recognize that sometimes the symptoms are a message from my body that I’ve gone outside my limits and need to ease up.
**Relaxing**
I’ve also developed a variety of other ways to reduce stress.
To help me relax, I have done a daily meditation for the last year and I also take 1.5 mg of Valium every morning. The Valium calms my central nervous and vestibular system enough to keep the dizziness that often plagues me mostly at bay and, I think, helps with the stress response. I have found that to have success with meditation I do best if I listen to guided meditation. With a voice to follow, I can stay on track.
**Planning and Routine**
One of the most important stress reducers for me is planning and routine. I carefully plan my week in such a way that I allow time in my schedule in case something unexpected arises that I must deal with. Because most days I rate myself at about 40 on the [CFS/FM rating scale](http://cfsselfhelp.org/files/rating_scale.pdf). I plan each day to include one or two activities outside the house.
For example, on Tuesday mornings I go to watercolor class. The class is 1.5 hours and though I love it, I find it draining, so I usually don’t do anything else outside the house that day. On Wednesday mornings I usually meet a friend for coffee for about an hour, but can usually plan to do something else later in the day – grocery store, doctor’s appointment, etc.
I limit most outings to about 1.5 hours max. I also try to have at least one or two days a week when nothing is on my calendar.
**Pleasure**
Pleasurable activities are important stress reducers for me. I try to plan a least one "fun" thing for each day – coffee with a friend or a trip to the library or bookstore gets me out of the house and doing something normal.
However, I’ve found that even good stress is stressful. I have to remind myself that some activities that I used to love are too noisy or simply leave my nerves overly jangled. One sad example for me is parties. I love getting together with groups of friends - but I pay for it for days after, so I had to re-think what constitutes fun for me.
When I am more stressed than usual I have found that quiet is important for my system to calm down again. Sitting or lying down in a quiet environment for an hour or so usually helps. Sometimes I can listen to an audio book - as long as it is not anything with any suspense.
**Acceptance**
Only recently have I come to realize that accepting that I have CFS is a huge stress reducer. I still absolutely hate having this disorder but I have realized that no one has a magic cure and it is highly unlikely that I am going to wake up tomorrow back to normal.
Rethinking what my life is and can be as a person with a significantly disabling disorder has allowed me to let go of some things I was making myself do in order to try to appear normal. I swallowed my pride and got a handicapped parking sticker for my car. And I am better at telling people “no, I can’t do that.”
**Conclusion**
I do believe that avoiding stress to the extent possible is a key to being able to eventually cope more successfully with the stressors of day-to-day life. Someone once told me to think of getting better as my job right now – and to give it the same time and attention I once gave to my work. It is a useful analogy for me. I consider stress avoidance and careful pacing as the tools I have to do the job. |

# CFS, FM and Dating: A Personal Story | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Mary Clark is a pseudonym of a 55 year old woman in the self-help program. She has had **ME/CFS and Fibromyalgia for 30 years. She also has migraines, orthostatic intolerance and other medical problems. She describes herself as mostly bed/couch bound. **Her article is based on a message sent to a discussion on dating.*
I want to respond from my own experience and focus on hope and on making the most of our strengths. I know that by doing this I run the risk of looking through rose-colored glasses and of minimizing the agony of our limitations.
I don't want to do that. I'm a big proponent of looking our limits square in the face and of making space in our lives to grieve, over and over again, our ongoing losses in order to free ourselves up to be truly alive.
That said, here are some hopeful thoughts from my own experience (next month will be 31 years since I first got sick).
It's been important for me to try to let go of the traditional idea of "dating." I was single when I got sick and since then I have married twice and been in a couple other serious relationships. With both of my husbands we became friends before we began to be romantically involved.
It's been challenging to make and maintain friendships in general but I do my best. . . keeping an open heart (when I'm not terrified of rejection) and trying to be creative in working around my limitations.
My second husband and I have known each other for a long time but with infrequent contact. One year he answered my Christmas card with a note about his new address, he and his wife had split up a year before, and giving me his email address. It was not lost on me that this was the first time we were both single at the same time :-).
Over the next 6 months we emailed each other from time to time. It seemed a little flirty to me but nothing I could really put my finger on. I tried not to think about it too much. Then he suggested he stop by (we lived about 45 minutes apart) to show me photos of his recent hiking trip with his son. I felt like a teenager--was this a date? just two friends getting together? My head was spinning.
He called to reschedule it (definitely not a date), then an email note from him that seemed flirty (definitely a date), then he was 45 minutes late (definitely not a date), then his arm leaned against mine as we looked at the photos (definitely a date), then he didn't call for a week (definitely not a date).
Slowly we discovered we **were** more than just friends and slowly we've built this marriage. It doesn't look like the romanticized ideal of a marriage because of my illnesses, but none of my friends' marriages look like the ideal either. We build our relationships from scratch, sometimes in spite of feeling we fall short of what we're "supposed" to be.
Especially for those of us with serious disabilities I think it's important to embrace our sexuality, no matter how limited, and to see our selves as sensual beings whether it's lovemaking or just feeling a gentle breeze across our cheek.
There can be a certain increased sensitivity that comes with the fact that our illnesses have forced us to be quiet and still and introspective at times. We have lost some of our energeticness but, perhaps, gained some depth.
I think that that same stillness can be a source of strength in our emotional relationship to a partner. Perhaps we have more time to reflect on what we see and hear from our partner and, just maybe, are able to provide them with a sense of being truly known and seen.
(This is an ironic thing for me to be writing this morning. My husband and I had a big argument last night and I'm sure he's feeling anything but "known and seen" at the moment. But I digress.)
After each break-up I have believed that I would always be single. And there certainly are some pluses to being single--especially around pacing and emotional stability. But here I am, late in life, madly in love. |

## detail-89-How-I-Lessen-Stress.html

# How I Lessen Stress | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Elena Rosen is a CFS patient from Vermont and a course leader in the CFIDS and Fibromyalgia Self-Help Program.*
Stress took a big toll on me when I was first sick with CFS; it overwhelmed me and made all my symptoms worse. But over several years I gained some control over the stressors in my life and this control has been a primary factor in my improvement from about 25% in 2008 to 80% six years later.
**Pacing to Reduce Stress**
To reduce the amount of stress in my life, my most essential tool is pacing, especially in the form of routine. Following a regular plan every day, I schedule activities and rest in time periods that correspond to my natural energy fluctuations.
This has led me to living within my energy envelope and reliably feeling better. While it may seem limiting to live on a schedule, it has brought much needed consistency and balance to my life.
Having structured protocols and practices for my daily life, as well as for various events, means I can live my life with less anxiety about overdoing it, because I don't have to put energy into figuring out when I'm going to rest, how I'm going to break a task down into manageable chunks or how I'm going to pace myself.
Once I had formed a good understanding of my energy envelope I was able to start to develop these routines. I used target setting to introduce new elements into my life one at a time.
I tracked how these changes were working using daily logs. (I also reviewed them weekly to see how my symptoms were reacting long term). It's taken me a bit of trial and error to find these routines but they are the foundation of the improvement in the last three years.
A good example of a healthy habit I developed through target setting was stretching. I had wanted to make gentle stretching part of my daily routine but was struggling with doing it consistently. I experimented through a series of targets aimed at finding the time of day that was most conducive to doing my stretches with the thought that if it's easier to do it, I'd be more likely to do it regularly.
I tried stretching when I first woke up, but it didn't work because I was too groggy. Then I tried stretching after my walk, but that didn't work because it was too much activity in one go. After lunch didn't work because it made me nauseous. Then I finally found the sweet spot: stretching before I began to get ready for bed. (As a bonus it even improved the quality of my sleep.)
I've found that it's also important to build flexibility into my routines. I try to have contingency plans in case of an unexpected event (a disastrous night's sleep, for example) and not question my body if it says it's not up for the full schedule for whatever reason.
**Stress from Socializing**
Since becoming ill, I've noticed that I struggle being in stressful situations, like large parties or crowded gatherings. Such situations can take a huge toll on my health. The stimulation of being around other people can be very draining. Some part of it is simply the sensory overload of following conversations, especially trying to keep up with more than one at a time.
Another part of it is my tendency towards being an emotional sponge and soaking up what people around me are feeling. This vulnerability became more pronounced when I got CFS. Being around people who are stressed or tense can be especially difficult for me and often leaves me with the awful feeling of being anxious for no reason at all. I call it the effects of "second-hand stress."
**Avoiding Stress**
The simplest way for me to deal with people or situations that are stressful is to avoid them as much as possible. While it is difficult for me to say no to people who I care about, my health is my first priority.
Remembering what I felt like in the past when I've overdone it and crashed helps lend me the strength to say "no" to situations and people that I know will overwhelm me. While this often means limiting myself to quiet alone time or small social gatherings, it is worth the difference it makes in my health.
It was a difficult transition from being a highly social person who was almost never alone, to needing to spend a large portion of my day alone. While solitude is not something that has come naturally to me I've learned to love and embrace it. When I have plenty of time to myself I'm better connected to my body and less likely to push myself outside of my energy envelope.
On the occasions when I have gotten stuck at a stressful event I go into "survival mode." I try to find a quiet place to sneak off and take a rest every hour or so (sometimes I have to get creative; a bathroom or the back seat of a car are always good options).
I also try to bring my own food, so I don't end up eating something off of my diet that will make me sick. If I have advance warning about the event I take extra rest the day before the event and plan on having a several lower activity days afterwards.
**Meditation**
Keeping up with a mediation practice is another tool in my arsenal for dealing with stress.
I often meditate while I'm laying down doing my daily rest. Most of the time I simply bring my awareness to my breath and try to keep it there. If my mind wanders I gently bring it back to watching my breathing.
If my mind is particularly restless or I'm under a lot of stress I'll listen to a guided mediation using headphones. Sometimes I just need the extra guidance of an outside voice talking me down and tell me exactly what to do to relax.
While meditating helps me when I'm feeling particularly anxious, I feel I get the most benefit from doing it consistently, even when I'm not stressed. I think that my regular mediation practice has retrained my mind so that going to a peaceful, centered place is my mind's default setting when I'm faced with negative thoughts.
When all else fails I've found that sometimes a little escapism can help alleviate stress. A good novel, TV show or movie allows me step outside of my life for a little while and every now and then that's exactly what I need. I keep a running list of books I want from the library and movies I'd like to rent, so if I'm really frazzled I don't have to put energy into trying to find something good.
Using routine, stress avoidance, meditation and other strategies has made a big difference. Reducing the stress in my life has reduced my symptoms and given my body the chance to heal.

# Limits, Logging and Better Health | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Elena Rosen is a CFS patient from Vermont and a course leader in the CFIDS and Fibromyalgia Self-Help Program.*
Developing a detailed understanding of my limits has been essential to escaping push/crash cycles and learning how to enjoy my life with CFS. My best tool for finding my limits has been the combination of experimentation and record keeping.
In fact, I’d say they have been crucial to my improvement from 25% in 2008 to 98% in 2019 on the CFS/FM Rating Scale .
**Linking Activity & Symptoms**
I started logging when I took the Introductory Self-Help course. My first log was adapted from the program’s Activity Log. I used the basic form of recording my activity level and comparing it to the levels of my symptoms.
I added a column to record my mood, so I could see how my emotions impacted my symptoms, and I also had a column to record how long I slept and to rate the quality of my sleep, as well as a column to rate how I felt overall that day.
When I reviewed my logs, I focused on the days I had rated very good or very poor. They provided me with ideas for what helped and what made my symptoms worse.
Having finite data that showed me how my energy, cognition, digestion, pain and sleep responded to different activities gave me the information I needed to begin my journey towards better health.
For example I could see how surfing the internet, something I had thought of as a fairly low-impact activity, increased my cognitive symptoms if I stayed on for more than an hour and even affected my sleep regardless of what time of day I did it.
**Experimenting to Gain Control**
Once I could clearly see what was causing my symptoms to flare, I experimented to find how I could gain control. In the case of surfing the internet, I began by experimenting with limits my computer time and by confining my computer usage to certain times of day, always noting the effects on my cognitive symptoms and sleep.
Through lots of trial and error, I found that my cognitive symptoms were minimally impacted if I limited myself to 3 twenty minutes chunks of time on the computer, interspersed with other less cognitively taxing activities.
I also found that cutting myself off from computer usage by dinner time kept it from affecting my sleep and my cognitive symptoms were the least impacted when I took most of my internet time in the morning.
Logging has also demystified the seemingly random fluctuations in my symptoms and showed me the patterns that my body naturally exhibits as well as the ones I cause.
**Focus on Reducing Pain**
When I've wanted to focus on understanding one particular area of my CFS (pain for example), I've expanded my records in that area to include sub-areas (separate columns under the pain heading for rating for joint pain, muscle pain, headache and notes to indicate where the pain is located).
To understand pain, I wrote that I had muscle pain at an eight in my hamstrings, lower back, biceps and forearms, joint pain at a five in my knees and headache at a five.
With this level of detail, I then spent some time lying down, put arnica and heat packs on my sore muscles, stayed somewhere quiet and dark to help my headache and scaled back physical activity for the next two days.
**Finding Causes of Flares**
I also use my reviews to identify probable causes of my flares. In this instance, I determined the likeliest cause of this flare was 30 minutes of vacuuming the previous morning. I made a note in the back of my log book, in the “future targets” section, that 30 minutes of vacuuming was too much and that I wanted to experiment with two or even three shorter sessions interspersed with rest.
The next time I needed to vacuum I did it in three fifteen minutes sessions spread out over the afternoon. I did other less physically challenging activities in between and stretched afterwards. The next day my pain level was normal, so I knew I had found a formula that could make vacuuming doable for me.
**Progress Through Experiments**
One of the great gifts of logging is that it has given me a safe way to try new activities and routines. I am careful to introduce new things one at a time and that makes it easy to see the impact, either positive or negative, they have on my symptoms.
My world has expanded as I've come to realize that activities I had written off as being too tough on me are available, as long as I do them in smaller chunks, or schedule more rest around them.
Also, looking at my health as a well documented experiment has also allowed me to take the emotional aspect out of evaluating my symptoms. Instead of beating myself up when I don't feel well, I am able to see in my logs why something isn't working and then make changes.
An example is my experience of seeing a movie weekly at my best friend’s house. I noticed that even though it was a comfortable and fun event, and ended early, my energy was significantly lower the next day. I turned to my logs to try and find a solution.
I discovered that even though I took a longer than usual afternoon rest on my movie days, my activity level was still averaging out to be the same as a normal day. So I experimented with lowering my activity level somewhat on my movie day.
When I made that change, my energy level the day after was normal and I’d discovered a new way to continue participating in an activity I loved and living within my limits.
**Summary: Benefits of Logging**
By adapting a more balanced, analytical attitude towards my symptoms, I’ve been able to get past the fear and uncertainty I had been experiencing. Seeing the direct correlation between my actions and my symptoms took the mystery out of flares, and made me feel that managing, and to a certain extent controlling my CFS, was within my power.
Finding my limits though logging has allowed me to expand my world without fear of a relapse. Knowing where my limits are gives me freedom to fill up all of the space inside them with nourishing, enjoyable activities. I've learned that it is possible for me to live a rich, fulfilling life with CFS.

## detail-91-Using-Targets-to-Improve-Health-and-Gain-Control.html

# Using Targets to Improve Health and Gain Control | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Elena Rosen is a CFS patient from Vermont and a course leader in the CFIDS and Fibromyalgia Self-Help Program.*
For my first few years with CFS, I tried to improve by making sweeping changes, an approach that always failed. Then I learned how to set small, realistic goals and that has made all the difference. By setting short-term targets, I have improved since my diagnosis from 15% on the [CFS/FM Rating Scale](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/files/rating_scale.pdf) to 98%, with much greater stability and a lower level of symptoms.
**Experiments with Exercise**
A good example of the power of small changes adding up over time is my experience with walking. I thought mild exercise would be good for me. With the idea in mind of setting a small, realistic goal, I made it a target to walk 1/16th of a mile every day at a very slow pace.
Once a week, if I was having a good day I started walking ten or twenty feet further. I kept slowly increasing the distance a little at a time, as long as I experienced no increase in my symptoms. As time went on I found that taking a short rest in the middle of my walk allowed me to walk even further. Now, I walk two and a half miles virtually every day.
**Logging and Target Setting**
Setting targets worked hand in hand with keeping records. Without logging, it was impossible to see the bigger picture of how my targets were affecting me. Keeping a daily record showed how my energy, cognition, digestion, pain and sleep responded to different activities.
By logging both my activities and my symptoms I began to see patterns and the connections between them. Soon I started to experiment with targets in order to establish my baseline tolerance for different activities.
For example in order to find out how long I could drive without aggravating my symptoms and still feel safe, I set a target to drive for five minutes three times a week and log after each drive. After keeping this target for two weeks my logs showed this amount of driving wasn't having any ill effects on my health.
I kept this as my baseline, but as time went on and my energy increased I would set a target to add one more day a week of driving or to make slightly longer drives. Sometimes these targets succeeded and I was able to increase my baseline and drive more. Sometimes it was too much too soon and I needed to stay with the amount of driving I had been doing. Either way I always gained information about my limits.
I've found that knowing for sure how much and how often I can do an activity is freeing. Even if I can't do it as often as I'd like, it makes me feel more secure having these guidelines in place so I can go through my day without worrying "am I doing too much?" or "Will I crash tomorrow?"
**Remembering Targets**
A problem I had initially with target setting was remembering my target. It's difficult enough to change deeply ingrained habits, but when you have brain fog as well, it makes it even more difficult.
One simple strategy I came up with was putting post-its or signs to remind me of my target. For example, when I had a target of limiting the amount of time I spent on the computer, I put a post-it on the edge of my monitor reminding me to take a break every forty-five minutes.
When I was struggling with staying up too late reading before bed, I made myself a bookmark that said, "No matter how good this book is put it down and go to sleep by 11: 30. You'll thank me in the morning!" I also make a note of my target in my log book every week, so every time I look at it I'm reminded to include my target in my plans for the day.
Another technique I've found helps with keeping me on track with targets is setting a timer. If I want to remember to take a break after thirty minutes of cooking I set the oven timer. If I want to do a rest before going out for the afternoon I set my alarm clock to go off in twenty minutes (that way I'm not peeking out from under my eye mask every five minutes to see if I've rested long enough yet).
**The Wider Applications For Target Setting**
Target setting has taught me that regular actions, no matter how small, can result in real change. Even though I first used targets to improve my health, I've found that target setting can help me to achieve other goals and to confront tasks that seem insurmountable.
An example is cleaning out a closet in my bedroom. It was in complete disarray and I had been avoiding it since becoming ill because it felt too overwhelming. Looking at it from the perspective of setting a target made me realize that trying to clean it all in one go, like I would have in the past, would cause a flare. I realized I'd have to break it up into smaller tasks and set a time limit on how long I worked.
I decided on two fifteen-minute sessions on two days a week. After the first week, my log showed no signs increased symptoms so I extended the sessions to 20 minutes. After three weeks, I'd accomplished a task that had been hanging over my head for months without any negative impact on my health.
This success, my experience with walking and my overall progress in recent years have all shown me that activities and tasks I had written off as being too taxing may still be available to me when I approach them a little at a time using target setting.

# Expanding My Envelope: How I Balanced Work and CFIDS | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Kristin Scherger is a CFIDS patient from Minnesota. She has participated in many groups of the CFIDS/Fibromyalgia Self-Help Program, including being the leader of several introductory courses.*
I have faced many challenges in my seven years with CFS, but few have been as significant as the fight for my career. When I first became ill, I had just begun working as an occupational therapist, a field I had dreamed of entering since I was a girl.
Fresh out of school, I had all the energy and motivation in the world. But a year later I came down with a late winter flu-like illness that I could not shake. Although I didn't have a name for it at the time, I had begun my adventure with CFS.
My life with CFS was like riding on a roller coaster. When my symptoms were strong, I would lie at home in bed for days. When I felt better, I would drag myself to work for several weeks before collapsing again and returning to bed.
I had always been able to push through other illness, but this time "pushing" only made things worse. The unimaginable had indeed occurred, and I was forced into facing the possibility of losing my career.
**Initial Efforts to Salvage My Career**
My first attempt to solve my career dilemma was to reduce my status to part-time. Working four hours every morning allowed me to rest and nap during the afternoon and evening.
But I continued to feel quite poorly and wasn't able to do much except work and rest. After several months my health showed very little improvement and my employer was unable to maintain my part-time status indefinitely.
My second solution was to work as an on-call occupational therapist. This involved being on a list that the hospital would call when they needed extra staff. Unfortunately, I soon found the job was not as ideal as it sounded.
I had difficulty saying no to work opportunities since I did not know when I'd have another chance to work again. So, I would work myself to exhaustion, then require days of rest to recover. Even though I only worked an average of two days per week, my life remained on a constant roller coaster.
**Emotional Consequences**
Not only was my work as an occupational therapist very energy consuming, but I also saw my attitude toward my job and toward my patients change for the worse. I became resentful of how much my career took out of me. I started to dread going into work, and became overwhelmingly focused on simply getting through the day so I could go home.
Also, I found I could no longer manage my anger and frustration. When patients were feeling sorry for themselves, I wanted to yell at them that they were not the only one with problems.
Prior to CFS I was proud of my ability to sympathize with my patients and effectively manage even the most difficult ones. Because of CFS I had become a less stable individual, one who was quite emotionally labile.
The career I had once loved had become a nightmare. But, despite my difficulties, it was nearly impossible for me to imagine leaving it. I had worked in healthcare since I was seventeen and had experienced happiness as an occupational therapist. But gradually I began to ask myself whether I should let go of a career in healthcare.
**New Insight: The Energy Envelope & Logging**
In the next few years, two things happened which gradually pointed me toward a solution. First, through counseling I recognized that I was not in fact recovering and that I had to accept that CFS was a central part of my life.
Second, I found some useful ideas in the CFIDS Self-Help Course. Two of the most helpful were the concepts of the Energy Envelope and logging. I learned that the Energy Envelope is the amount of energy a person can expend without making symptoms worse.
Through logging I was able to establish an obvious connection between a day of work, and a severe spike in my symptoms. I kept a daily log of my activities and the time I spent at them. I identified how demanding of my energy each activity was using a scale I created.
I also included my symptoms and their severity using another scale. My roller coaster life had become a clear example of an individual living outside her Energy Envelope.
Logging convinced me that I had to change careers. My records showed clearly that during weeks I worked, my symptoms were high and I was not able to do much beyond going to work, resting up for work, or recuperating after work. Using the 0 to 100CFS/Fibromyalgia Rating Scale, I estimated my level during that time to be between 20 and 40.
My life during other weeks was a big contrast. When I didn't work, I was able to do more and my symptoms remained lower. I successfully maintained myself at 40 to 50 on the rating scale. I concluded that I needed to leave my career as an occupational therapist and find work that was within my Energy Envelope. If I did not do this, I would never get off the roller coaster.
**A Difficult Experiment**
But the idea of looking for a new job outside the medical world was scary. To begin with, my self-confidence already suffered from trying to cope with my CFS symptoms. Also, I was worried that the loss of my comfortable income would place financial hardships on my husband and me. Finally, I had no idea how to begin to look for a job outside the occupational therapy field, or how to "sell" myself to a potential employer.
I applied for various jobs without success. A breakthrough came one day when I received a call from a local park district, with whom I had interviewed unsuccessfully for a receptionist job. They asked if I would be interested in a temporary job with them.
Suddenly I had a "safe" solution. I could try something new without being required to make a huge commitment or formally quit my job at the hospital. This enabled me to experiment with a new job, while having the security of knowing my once beloved and financially stable career was still there for me.
**Successful Lessons**
For nearly the first six months of my new job I felt very much out of my element and unsure of myself. Gradually, I became comfortable with my job and gained appreciation from my new employer. Eventually, when an internal job opened up that was of interest to me, my employer thought highly enough of me to adapt the position so I could apply for it.
Now, nearly one and a half years later I am still with the park district. I found a job in Risk Management that allows me to use my healthcare background and people skills. I rarely find myself missing my former career.
And although my wage is not what it was as an occupational therapist, it is very respectable and satisfying. And incredibly, I once again enjoy going in to my job every day (well...there are days I'd love to play hooky!)
Most significantly though, my change in jobs enabled me to expand my Energy Envelope. I now spend significantly more time active than in rest. This is the complete opposite of my experience when I was working as an occupational therapist.
My activity level and symptom level are now even better than those times a few years ago when I was not working at all. Currently, I estimate myself at 60 on the Rating Scale. On occasion, I even experience periods at 70.
Since my Energy Envelope has become larger, I have become a firm believer in the self-management of CFS. The knowledge that I have control over my life has provided me with the hope that I can continue to apply self-management principles in my life, further expanding my Energy Envelope.
And I've gained confidence that I can find the strength to make changes when life presents me with challenges.

## detail-93-How-I-Used-Rest-to-Escape-Push-and-Crash.html

# How I Used Rest to Escape Push and Crash | Treating CFS & FM

|
By Kate Morgan
* *
*Note: Kate is a CFS/Fibromyalgia patient from Toronto who works as an office manager in a high school. She joined the CFIDS & FM Self-Help Program in 2014.*
I have learned a lot from the self-management program and what I’ve learned about proper resting has been the key to my stopping the cycle of push and crash.
Rests of the several types I’ll describe are the mainstays in my wellness plan. They make it possible for me to stay within my limits. No treatments, medications, supplements, work as effectively for me as my rests. They are the heart and soul of my self-management plan.
**Scheduled Rests**
The first type is *scheduled rest breaks*, which I take three times a day. These rests vary from 15 minutes to an hour, depending on a combination of what my body needs and the time available. For these rests, I lay down, glasses off, lights out and with a blanket for warmth.
The first scheduled rest is in the morning after I get up, wash, dress and eat. Usually a short rest is fine, 15 to 20 minutes just to reset myself. The second rest is after lunch. Mornings are my most difficult time so I find I usually need at least 30 minutes mid- day to balance my energy. My final scheduled rest is around 4:30. This is usually after work, and I find, depending on how my day was, I may need anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes to recover from the energy output of the day.
I usually listen to a guided meditation during my rests, but if I’m not in the mood for a guided meditation, I simply watch my breath until my body feels ready to move. I usually use a meditation because I've found that the quality of rest is as important as the length of time I rest. If I can't quiet my mind, I get up more tired than when I started. Meditation helps to quiet my busy "monkey mind."
My planned rests are my highest priority in the day and are written into my daily log sheets. They are so ingrained into my routine now that it comes quite naturally to just go do them when I need to. My partner and family are also really good about "shooing" me off to rest if I've been highly active for too long.
**Pre-Exertion and Post-Exertion Rests**
I call the second and third types of rest breaks *pre-exertion *and *post-exertion rests***.** These are brief rest before and after any activity I rate as medium or high demand. I do them either lying down or sitting in a chair, closing my eyes and doing some deep breathing.
(Medium level activities for me usually include anything that involves standing and or bending. High level activities can involve, standing, bending, walking, lifting, stair climbing etc. Any trips outside of my home I rate as high activity.)
I do these short, paired rests throughout the day as often as needed. For example, before I go for a walk, I'll lie down for 15 minutes. Then, when I get home from the walk, I lie down for another 15 minutes. If I’m unloading the dishwasher, I'll do one tray, go sit down for 5 to 10 minutes then return and do the 2nd tray and then sit down again for 5 to 10 minutes.
My three planned daily rests keep me refreshed and help me to live within my Energy Envelopes. And my pre-exertion and post-exertion rests allow me to do "extra activities" throughout my day without increasing my symptoms or causing a relapse.
**Mini Rests and Out-of-House Rests**
In addition to those ways that I incoporate rest into my life, I use two additional types of rest on an “as-needed” basis. I call them *mini rests* and *out-of-house rests*.
I take quick rest breaks throughout the day if I’m more fatigued than normal, get a sudden “hit by a truck” exhaustion or have been more active than expected. These breaks can be as simple as sitting quietly in a chair with my eyes closed for 5 minutes or taking an additional flat rest for 5 to 15 minutes.
** **
Lastly, I’ve found it helpful to take a walker with me if I'm going to be out and about in the world. With my walker handy, I am able to sit down as soon as I start to feel increased fatigue, muscle pain or weakness.
** **
As soon as I feel any of those symptoms, I push my walker off to the side, sit and do some deep breathing.WhenI feel the fatigue or pain lift a bit, usually within 5 minutes, I carry on, but I repeat the process as soon as I feel tired again. If I don’t “perk” up quickly I take it as a sign that I need to be heading home for a full flat rest.
**Additional Rest-Related Strategies**
As a reminder to take my rests, I've programmed my cell phone to chime every two hours to remind me to check in with myself and either rest or change my activity: move if I've been sitting too long, stretch out if I've been knitting or go lay down if it is my rest time.
Also, I’ve found that sometimes my body starts to feel energetic or “wired” about 8 or 9 at night, just when I need to be winding down for the long rest we call sleep. I’ve found that a hot bath or use of the hot tub in the evening, followed by a flat rest, some gentle stretches and a short guided meditation helps me relax, get "unwired" and able to fall sleep.
I would also like to note that in addition to needing multiple rests every day, I have found that I need to avoid having too much rest, which can actually increase my fatigue and muscle pain. So I have an ongoing challenge to find the right amount of rest, not too little and not too much.
**Conclusion**
To wrap up, I have found that to avoid the push and crash cycle it is essential that I have a minimum of three scheduled rests periods per day, as well as several pre- and post-exertion rests based on my activity level. In addition, I make use of mini rests if my symptoms require it, and I take out-of-house rests using a walker when I’m out in the world**.**
Using the various self management strategies I learned through the introductory class, I feel much more in control of my life and my symptoms, but the key to my stability are my five types of rest.

# Pacing Strategies That Help Me | Treating CFS & FM

|
By Kate Morgan
*Note: Kate is a CFS/Fibromyalgia patient from Toronto who works as an office manager in a high school. She joined the CFIDS & FM Self-Help Program in 2014.*
I struggled a lot with CFS/fibromyalgia and experienced many rounds of push and crash before taking the Introductory course. Thankfully, by using the pacing strategies I learned there and will describe in this article, my crashes aren't as frequent or as severe as they used to be and my recovery time doesn’t last as long. Also, I’ve learned a strategy for avoiding relapses.
One part of pacing is recognizing the many ways we affect our symptoms. Here’s what I have learned makes my symptoms worse and what I’ve found I can do to reduce my symptoms.
**What Makes My Symptoms Worse**
**1) Skipping My Scheduled Rest Breaks **
Through experimentation, I found that I need three major rest breaks a day (7:30 am, noon and 4:30), plus two brief rests, at 10 and 2. I'm usually OK if I skip the short rests, but if I skip the others, I pay the next day, with substantially increased fatigue, muscle pain and brain fog.
**2) Overdoing**
If I do more than my body can tolerate I crash. Overdoing falls into one of two categories.
** **
· *Overscheduling*: Planning more than one appointment (medical, personal errand, etc.) in a two week span. If the event is a social outing, the limit is one per month.
· *Overexertion*: Doing more than my body can tolerate. Some examples include going up the stairs at work more than once a day, unloading the dishwasher and putting laundry away on the same day, or going 10 paces too far on my usual walking route.
**3) Sensory Overload**
This refers to overstimulation of two types. The first is from noise, lights, smells, people, crowds, and talking. All these types of sensory input intensify my symptoms.
The second is overstimulation of emotions from TV shows, reading, etc. I find that an extreme state of either good or bad emotions triggers fatigue. I do best when I can keep my emotional state in the “middle of the road.”
** **
**What Reduces My Symptoms**
**1) Taking Rest Breaks **
**2) Using a Heart Rate Monitor **
The monitor tells me if my heart rate is OK or in the area where symptoms are intensified. If I’m over my limit, I stop what I'm doing and rest until my heart rate comes back within my safe zone.
For example, if my monitor says the rate is too high when I climb stairs, I pause half way up the stairs and rest. [Note: You can find a formula for calculating safe and unsafe heart rates in the article [Pacing By Numbers](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/library/pacing-numbers-using-your-heart-rate-to-stay-inside-energy-envelope).]
**3) Using a Pedometer **
By wearing a pedometer, I have found that my pain and fatigue increase if I take less than 3,000 or more than 4,000 steps per day. So I have a small window of "just right" and I try to keep my steps within that range. The pedometer really helps me to stay in my Energy Envelope.
**4) Logging **
I can't say enough about the importance of keeping records. I use a phone app to log activity levels and symptoms. The app is very simple and it takes me only a few minutes throughout the day to enter the information. What I like best is the bar graph that will show me my exertion rate vs my exhaustion rate.
Once a week, I transfer the highlights from my app (energy vs fatigue levels, pain levels, etc.) onto a paper calendar, so I can get an overview of how I’m doing. The whole system helps me plan my daily activities and rests. Also, I use the paper calendar to plan my activities for a month so I can see at a glance where I'm scheduling busy days too close together.
To summarize, logging is key for me as I can visually see (a) a reminder of when to take my rest breaks (b) how many activities and at what level (low, medium or high) I have planned over a week or month (c) the cause and effect of my activities vs symptoms.
** **
**Avoiding a Relapse**
The self-help program suggests that we think about non-routine events differently from everyday life. These special events make extra demands and often trigger relapses. Based on this understanding of special events, I adopted a saying and a question to help me decide how to manage such events:
The saying: I can't do everything
The question: What will it cost me?
Let me give you an example.
Recently, my family and extended family were going on a weekend trip. I was expected to join them. But the idea of the trip made me anxious. My life had been going well; for the first time in years, I had made it through the first six weeks of school without a crash or severe flare. I worried that attempting a trip might knock me into a major flare.
So I reminded myself of my saying and my question. To answer the question, I reflected on the cost if I went on the trip, measured in terms of the effects on my various Energy Envelopes.
Thinking about the effects on my physical activity envelope of a three and a half hour drive each way, I had to acknowledge that it would be greatly fatiguing. I wouldn't be able to manage the sightseeing and would end up spending most of the time in the hotel. So I told myself, in that case I'd rather stay in my own home.
In addition to physical exertion, I would be exposed to an increase in external stimuli, noise, lights, sounds. This would add greatly to my fatigue and thus to the recovery time after the trip. And third, my social/emotional envelope, which is my most restrictive, would be completely depleted by spending three days with a large extended family group with no place for quiet recovery
**The Alternative**
So I asked myself, “What would happen if I stayed home?” The answer: I would have three days of blissful quiet and peace in my own safe environment and I would return to work on Tuesday feeling stable and rested. So I chose not to go on the trip.
** **
As always, my family were very supportive of my choice. They had a wonderful trip and came home and shared stories and pictures with me. As for me, I rested quietly, enjoyed a few slow walks in the neighbourhood park to take in the fall colours and returned to work feeling calm and rested, living fully within my energy envelopes.

# Reducing Stress by Lessening Worry | Treating CFS & FM

|
By Kate Morgan

I had managed to simplify my life, set up routines, take regular rest breaks daily, and manage my stress to the point where I had improved to having about 50% of my days being fairly good.
Then all of a sudden, I slid into a full-blown crash. So I asked myself what had changed? This article is about what I learned from exploring that question.
**Worry, Self-Talk and Stress**
The first thing I realized was that I had been worrying about an upcoming event: having houseguests for three weeks. My self-talk quickly got out of control. I asked myself:
· How will I cope?
· What will they expect of me?
· Will they understand I'm ill?
· Will they make stupid comments like "you don't look ill"?
· Will they think I'm rude and ruining their vacation?
· Will my supportive family still be supportive or will they look at me differently based on what the guests say?
· Will the guests wear smelly stuff that I react to?
· Will they be loud and not understand my need to avoid so much stimuli?
That’s not all. It got to the point I was having arguments in my head with the guests, and they hadn't even arrived!
It’s probably not a surprise that my worry-filled self-talk had gotten me so worn out and stressed that I crashed.
**Strategies**
At that point, I reread a part of one of Toni Bernhard’s books, which reminded me about simplicity and mindfulness. Everything is impermanent; all that exists is the current moment and how I respond to that it.
I told myself, “In this moment, I can breathe, I can rest. I can say ‘stop!’ when the self-talk starts up. I can laugh when I see myself arguing with people that aren't even in my country yet, let alone in the same room with me. I can stop fighting with myself. I can stop borrowing trouble. I can rest, laugh and recover.”
Then I took some practical steps in preparation for the visit. First, inspired by the [article](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/library/pacing-and-assertiveness) about the woman with CFS who talked to her friend about making his visits manageable, I emailed the guests.
I wrote them not to bring any perfumes, colognes, scented lotions, shampoos etc. I also included part of my logging book, which outlined my routines for a "good day," highlighting the number of rest breaks I require.
I stressed that even on a good day, I might have to take extra rests and that I can usually only socialize for about 30 minutes before needing at least an hour rest.** **
** **
Further, I wrote, I always struggle until mid afternoon and that we would stock up the kitchen if they could provide us with a list of food items they would like for breakfast and lunch, so that they could manage those meals for themselves. Dinner would be prepared by my partner and I would join them on my “good days”.
** **
To emphasize that they would be largely on their own while visiting, I provided pamphlets on city sightseeing ideas as well as the local transit map.
** **
As soon as I sent off the email, I experienced a sense of great relief. My self-talk calmed down, and I began to relax.
** **
The visit went off with little stress. Our friends got to spend lots of time with my partner and extended family and I joined in when I could. I experienced no flare ups or crashes either during or after the visit, though I scheduled a low activity week after they left to ensure that I remained stable.
**Reducing Stress From Another Source**
Shortly after the houseguests left, I had another experience of worry-induced stress. In this case, I felt stressed by something you’d think would make me happy: feeling better.
When I recognized that I was able to do a bit more without intensifying my symptoms, I felt terrified that I would do too much and trigger a severe relapse.
I also realized that I didn’t want to tell anyone that I was feeling better because I didn’t feel prepared to deal with all that might come with that: higher expectations from people, specifically the expectation that I could return to working full hours rather than my reduced schedule.
Then I realized that worrying about the expectations from other people was a form of self-imposed stress. Just recognizing that it was my self-talk that created the stress, not other people’s behavior, was a big relief.
And it turned out that I received support from others, who said things like “it’s good that you’re doing better, but don’t rush anything; you don’t want to get worse.” So my worries were unfounded.
Second, in addition to recognizing that much of the stress was due to self-talk, I recommitted myself to doing several self-management strategies for stress reduction:
1. Give myself a daily reminder: Feeling good is dangerous for people with CFS, so I’ll only do 50% of what I think I can each day.
2. Stick to my three 20-minute rest breaks daily, especially when my brain says I don't need them.
3. Keep logging and viewing my weekly schedule in advance to make sure I book in at least two full rest days per week and don't overbook appointments.
4. Meditate twice a day
5. Check in all day to monitor my breathing so I keep it deep and slow.
**Update**
Several months have passed since the events I described above and I am still seeing improvement. Most significantly I got through the first two months of school without a crash, the first time since my major CFS/fibro relapse four years ago I have managed to do that.
I have occasional mild to moderate flare ups, but I recover quite quickly now with just a day or two of extra rest. This is a big improvement and a change that makes me hopeful for the future.

# How I Manage My Many Energy Envelopes | Treating CFS & FM

|
By Kate Morgan
*Note: Kate is a CFS/Fibromyalgia patient from Toronto who works as an office manager in a high school. She joined the CFIDS & FM Self-Help Program in 2014.*
A central idea of the self-help program is the concept of Energy Envelopes, meaning both one’s overall limits, called the Big Envelope, and limits in different areas of life, the Little Envelopes.
During the time I’ve been in the program, my Big Envelope has expanded from about 25 on the [Rating Scale](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/files/rating_scale.pdf) to 55 now. My Little Envelopes vary; some areas are more restrictive than others. Let me explain and also tell you how I manage my envelopes.
**Physical Envelope**
My envelope for physical activity is one of my smallest and most challenging. I can only stand briefly. Bathing and showering are exhausting and require a five to 10 min rest immediately after. I can only do very minimal housework. For example, I load and unload the dishwasher in stages and do the same when putting laundry away.
Before I accepted my physical limits, I tried to push through and live like I did before my illness, but of course that only made my symptoms worse.
What helps me manage this challenging envelope is three regular scheduled rests a day, each lasting 15 to 30 minutes, with additional shorter rests as needed.
Also, I keep the number of steps I take between per day 3000 and 4000, stand only for brief periods and keep my heart rate below 96. For more on why Kate limits walking and uses a heart rate monitor, see her article [Pacing Strategies That Help Me (see: Pacing Strategies That Help Me).]
To counteract deconditioning as well as to help with stiffness and pain, I exercise in two ways. First, I take two 25-minute walks each week, both scheduled for days I’m not working. And I do gentle stretching in bed or in a chair a couple times a week.
**Mental Envelope**
My envelope for cognitive tasks is my largest and the reason that I am able to continue to work four days a week. For the most part, I can easily read, be on the computer, or do things like knitting, for great lengths of time, as long as I haven't been exhausted by overdoing my other envelopes.
I can get fatigued quickly if the activity is extremely challenging mentally, such as balancing the budget at work. But I find that when I'm starting to feel fatigue, if I change the mental activity, say from computer work to reading, I can bounce back from fatigue without needing a rest.
Also, sometimes a change to a physical activity, such as getting up to stretch or walk around, will reduce the fatigue.** **
**Social Envelope**
My envelope for time with people is my smallest and most challenging. It gets used up quickly by my job. I can manage only five to 10 minutes on the phone before becoming exhausted. In person social events are manageable if kept under one hour and then I need to lie down in bed for a couple of hours.
On the rare occasions I attempt a social event, it has to be at lunch time or early afternoon; evenings don’t work for me.
The only social activities that have on a regular basis are family events. I'm very fortunate that my partner and extended family are extremely supportive and all events are held at our house.
This means I can rest comfortably in my own bed and join the family for short periods of time and then retire to my bed when I need to rest again. In this way, I can participate within my limits and not suffer for days or weeks after.
For a while, I spent a considerable amount of time each day on social media, but then I realized that even though I can spend hours on the computer reading and researching, the time spent on social media could be as draining as in-person social activity.
I developed several strategies in response. First, I now turn off the computer, TV and cell phone by 8:00 pm. Second, I read and/or answer only urgent emails on a daily basis, leaving other emails to read and respond once or twice a week on a non-work day and even then, limiting the time to less than one hour per session.
Using these strategies has reduced my fatigue and improved my sleep, so I have made them part of my daily routine.
**Sensory Envelope**
Exposure to external stimuli, especially lights, noise and allergens, is probably the biggest trigger for increased symptoms and higher fatigue levels. The sensitivity caused by CFS and fibro are intensified by my severe asthma and multiple chemical sensitivities.
At home, I can control this sensitivity with low level lighting and limiting the amount of time TV and radios are on. At work, I have little to no control, so I manage the exposure by closing my office door when I need a break from the noise, and going to a quiet room throughout the day for rest breaks.
Also, I have found a few restaurants close to home that have a quiet environment for the few times I attempt a social outing.
** **
**Stress Envelope**
I was great at handling chaos and emergencies pre illness. Now the slightest hiccup in my day and I can feel everything unravelling inside of me. So my envelope for stress is very small.
Something as minor as going to a new store or anything out of my normal, safe routine can trigger stress levels that are out of proportion to the event. I counteract this response with a lot of breath control, meditation, rests and mindfulness practice. Still, I have to be very, very careful with this envelope.
**Emotional Envelope**
I find that extreme emotions of any kind, positive or negative, increase my stress and create fatigue. My response is to aim to keep my emotions “middle of the road” in order to avoid an energy crash.
Also, I use two strategies to create positive emotions. First, I start my day by recording in my journal one thing I am looking forward to that day. In addition, at the end of the day I enter five things I am grateful for. Some days (depending on my symptom levels) its really hard to find five.
However, I have noticed that consciously switching my mind at the end of the day to something positive is very rewarding and also helps me to sleep better.
**Keys to Living within My Energy Envelopes**
The main tools that help me to live within my Energy Envelopes are:
- Taking daily scheduled flat rests
- Only adding a new activity into my schedule if I can offset it with additional rest breaks
- Limiting my social activity (in person, on the phone or via computer and social media)
- Avoiding exposure to external stimuli
- Managing stress and my emotional state effectively
Learning to live within my Energy Envelopes has substantially reduced the push/crash cycle, to the point that I have an occasional flare up of symptoms, but not crashes, and my quality of life has improved considerably.

# Adapting to Fibromyalgia | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Editor's Note: Jana is a fibromyalgia patient from New York. After making a career change, she has developed a private practice as a licensed massage therapist.*
When I received the diagnosis of fibromyalgia at age 45, I realized I had been unknowingly living with illness and denying it most of my life. Even as a child, I felt like my nerves were all prickly and fuzzy like static buildup. I lived with pain, stiffness, fatigue and trouble sleep. Into adulthood weather changes, certain foods, lights, sound, the touch of my clothes, even thinking hurt.
Every day was an exhausting struggle. But the worst would pass, and I would be told how healthy I looked and that I was just out of shape and needed to push myself harder and that there was really nothing wrong with me and I was just too sensitive. I accepted this view of myself and lived in denial of the truth of my experience.
**The Positive Power of Diagnosis**
I viewed the diagnosis of fibromyalgia as a validation of my experience. What I had been feeling was real. And it wasn't just normal aches and pains that I should have been able to put up with. Diagnosis didn't come with a cure, but it gave me something I could work with. I felt empowered.
With the diagnosis it was clear that the pain was inevitable, but the suffering I was putting myself through denying it was optional. After my diagnosis, instead of ignoring symptoms, pushing through, and berating myself for feeling so poorly for ‘no good reason' as if it were a personal failure, I realized I had to pay close attention to these symptoms, to really listen to what my body was trying to say to me.
**Finding What Works and What Doesn't**
In order to manage illness, I had to let go of my resistance to illness and plunge right into it. I learned that I do much better if I try to understand what my needs are and how I can best get them met. I had to learn to be on the lookout for signs of impending relapse. These were the very signs I had always tried to ignore before.
Keeping an activity/symptom log and journaling helped me to focus on how I was feeling moment-to-moment and learn to recognize the warning signs. This was a way of being in the world quite different from the task-oriented, pushing-through-the-pain method I had been praised for using before.
Initially, my focus was on finding my limits, or, as I prefer to call them now, boundaries. As I discovered circumstances that triggered relapse, such as overbooking my work schedule or visiting crowded noisy places, I began taking action to reduce or eliminate these precipitating factors. This meant I had to learn to say ‘no' sometimes, but in that ‘no' is a resounding ‘yes' to maintaining my health and well-being.
Over time, I changed my focus from trying to find out what was ‘wrong' with me and what made me feel worse to discovering what helps me to feel better and incorporating more of that into my life. I put my problem solving abilities to new use, finding new ways to do things to better meet my needs and adapt to life with fibromyalgia.
**Practical Solutions**
I found that different types of activity, mental and physical, had different degrees of effect on my health. For example, certain kinds of kitchen work, like standing and chopping lots of veggies, are harder on me than others.
The longer I stand in place or the more repetitive my movements are, the more quickly I experience pain and fatigue. But I can space the activity out and not chop all that I need at one time. Or I can take some work out of my standing-room-only kitchen to do sitting comfortably on the sofa.
Certain kinds of office work, like following up on medical insurance claims, is worse than others. I guess with that one, it's the frustration level and brain drain that wipes me out. I used to push myself to leave my in-basket empty before quitting for the day. But it's better for my health if I work through one problem early in the day and leave the rest for another time.
The time of day I attempt things makes a difference. I noticed that I can walk about two blocks in the evening, but three has me collapsing. However, I can do three or more early in the day. I seem to have a window between 8:00 and 11:00 in the morning that is best for most activity, mental and physical.
I stopped the push and crash cycle and gave myself more space by pacing my activities and balancing them with rest. I use a timer for some activities that I tend to over do, like working on the PC, to remind me to take a break. Setting up a daily routine with lots of wiggle room has been helpful. I have the bones of routine, but with space for the unexpected emergencies of life as well as room for spontaneity and fun.
Maintaining control of my workspace and schedule has been very beneficial. I have learned that making a good living is not the same thing as making a good life and have redefined what having a successful career means. I am successful when I can feel good about the work I have done and still have the energy to give my friends a hug.
I have learned to let go of the need to please others and limit my work hours to what I know I can successfully accomplish without burning out. I now schedule my energy rather than my time and have a balance of work and rest that energizes rather than depletes me.
I do better with short periods of different activities, spacing similar activities apart with different kinds of activities in between, including pre-emptive rests, rather than large blocks of time devoted to a single activity. That's so different from how I used to work. I would get involved with a project and not come up for food or air until it was done and be surprised I'd missed meals and the sun had set.
I see now that this was a way of coping with the pain and confusion, blocking it out by focusing on completing a single task. But this method led to crashing. I realize now that it's best for me to keep moving and not get stuck, literally, in one position or one activity for too long.
**Stress Management**
Awareness and acceptance of my limits and what aggravates symptoms has helped me to avoid certain situations that are stressful, such as being with large groups of people all talking at once or spending too much time in a store with bright fluorescent lighting.
I am much more vigilant about staying out of smoke-filled rooms and avoiding foods I am allergic to. (I was amazed to find how many foods aggravated symptoms.) I now stop to rest at the first sign of illness rather than just loading up on drugs and pushing through until I collapse.
Stress avoidance is not always possible, so I have learned many methods of reducing the negative effects of stress. I use a variety of tools depending on the needs of the moment. Deep relaxation through therapeutic massage and healing bodywork usually works best for me.
I also respond well to long soaks in a hot tub or steam room, meditation and prayer, visualization, and gentle exercise such as long, deep yoga stretches, tai chi, slow meditative walks, and mindful movement. However, sometimes something more vigorous for a shorter period of time, like a brisk walk or jumping on my mini-trampoline, works better.
Asking for assistance when I need it helps to both avoid and reduce the effects of stress. For example, when I feel a relapse coming on, I ask my husband for a massage. Massage addresses so many aspects of fibromyalgia for me.
It relaxes tension, reduces pain and stiffness, releases negative emotions, and helps me sleep. It has proven to be such a great stress manager and healer that my husband now offers without waiting to be asked. And this has improved our relationship as well.
I monitor myself more moment-to-moment now and do what keeps my energy up and my pain level down. Comforts I had considered luxuries I now view as necessities. Having comfortable clothes, shoes, bed, chair, temperature, and lighting cuts down on unnecessary stress.
I do more things, like dancing and playing the piano, just for the fun of it without trying to be perfect at it. Having fun reduces stress, energizes, and eases pain.
I avoid a great deal of stress by letting certain things be as they are. This has been a difficult lesson as I am a recovering perfectionist. For example, I have learned to be at peace and not get upset because someone else has messed up the kitchen.
I no longer rush to clean it by myself even though I can barely stand up. And I recognize now that, in the long run, it doesn't really matter if my floors aren't spotless or the laundry doesn't get done on Saturday.
**Free to Be Me**
Deepening my understanding and acceptance of how this illness affects me has generated an inner strength that has helped me change the way I live my life so that I now do what is right for me. I am more at peace within myself now than ever before. I have learned that it's not about what happens to me; it's about how I deal with what happens to me that makes all the difference. |

## detail-99-How-I-Found-Freedom-Through-Acceptance-and-Adaptation.html

# How I Found Freedom Through Acceptance and Adaptation | Treating CFS & FM

|
*Note: Bianca Veness, a CFS patient from Australia, is a moderator in the CFIDS & Fibromyalgia Self-Help program. This article is adapted from messages sent to a group she led. *
Rebelling against the need to be disciplined is one of the biggest challenges I've had to overcome in dealing with CFS. I used to hate living a regulated life, so I ignored my body's limits, and suffered intense symptoms and frequent crashes. I turned things around when I accepted that discipline was the only way to treat my illness successfully.
**Giving in to Gain Control**
I knew having CFS meant I needed to live my life more carefully, but sometimes I got fed up with the whole idea of managing my illness. It felt like a burden. It felt like too much hard work. "Why should I have to live my life so carefully?" I asked myself. "Healthy people don't."
I was frustrated by the need to adapt to my illness. Even though pacing and managing my CFS made me feel better, I felt like I was being forced into it. I rebelled against the idea of being told what to do, even if I was the one doing the telling.
I think my defiance stemmed from not accepting I was sick and not acknowledging my life would have to change because of it. Eventually, I realized fighting my illness was only making things worse. The illness was not some outside invader trying to take me over, but my own body begging for rest and a stress-free life, begging for some time to heal itself.
I realized that surrendering to the illness was the only way I could improve my health. There was not some magic pill that was going to cure me. If I wanted to be well, I had to accept my body's demands, no matter how severe these seemed to be.
With this realization, I finally became comfortable with the changes I was making in my life, and I was able to manage my illness effectively for the first time. And as I began to see results from living within my energy envelope, I felt motivated to continue.
**Using a Flexible Schedule**
The transformation into a more disciplined person has been gradual and often difficult. I'm not naturally an organized person and I have trouble keeping to a routine. For me, the key to success is flexibility. I use a special, flexible kind of schedule. Every morning I write a To Do list, but I choose what tasks I'll do and in what order I'll do them.
I also use a chart to map the time I spend resting - two hours each in the morning, afternoon and evening. I can have this rest whenever I want to, in short rests or longer ones. In this way, I'm keeping within my limits, but adapting my life to circumstances and desire.
By keeping to a routine, I can feel better and do more. I free myself from the control of the illness. Whenever I feel frustrated at having to live within strict limits, I ask myself, "Do I want to run my life, or do I want to let the illness do it?" Or I ask, "Is it better to live in chaos and feel terrible all the time, or keep to a schedule and feel better? Is exceeding my limits worth the pain?"
It's all about changing how I think about doing things that are good for my health. I now see them not as a duty, but as a choice. I am choosing to do everything I can do to feel better.
Since I changed my attitude, I don't see routine as a frustration anymore. I look on it as a way to set myself free from crippling symptoms and an uncertain existence. I see myself as a full-time carer. It is my job to manage this illness and look after a sick person (me!).
How well I do it will determine how good I feel and how much I can accomplish. I look on the illness itself as a teacher, who is teaching me to listen to and love my body, and to slow down and enjoy life.
I still have days when I can't make myself live within my energy envelope no matter what I do, but I use reframing to help me move on. Instead of beating myself up about it, I just think, "That was today, tomorrow will be better."
I see my routine as a way to love and nurture my body. I praise myself for everything I do to improve my health, and I see managing my illness successfully as my greatest achievement.
**Small Steps and Rewards **
I use many techniques to manage my illness. (I have described some of them in the article How I Use Pacing To Manage CFS (see: How I Use Pacing to Manage CFS).) Some people have told me they felt tired and discouraged when they read the long list of strategies I use. All I can say is that I didn't start doing them all at once!
The transformation into a more disciplined person was a long-term process. I introduced these changes gradually, maybe one a week at best, and I made sure I found the right one before adding the next. I go one step at a time, and I experiment until I find a strategy that works for me.
For example, I spent many months trying to find the ‘right' way to improve my sleep. I tried keeping sleep diaries, setting targets to go to bed at a certain time, using sleep medications, waking myself up early - nothing worked, or it only worked for a short time.
What has ended up working best is keeping a ‘sleep hygiene scorecard' where I give myself points for various actions: going to bed early, journaling before bed, turning off the TV and computer at a certain time, and so on. When I reach 100 points, I give myself a reward.
It might sound silly, but it really helps! It's such a fun way of improving my sleep, and if I feel like having the occasional late night I can, but the incentive is there to have a good sleep routine.
I adapt my routine to suit me. I make resting fun, with talking books, good music, or relaxation tapes (as well as resting quietly sometimes). I reward myself and give myself praise by keeping a journal each day of all the positive things I've done for my health. (I've found praise is a much better teacher than punishment.)
I keep my routine flexible and adapt when needed. If something isn't working or I'm finding it frustrating, I get creative and find a different way of doing it. And I have to say I enjoy it! When you're suffering so much uncertainty in your body and your life, having a routine can be a great comfort, and a way to feel like you're moving forward with your health.
**The Bottom Line: From Control to Acceptance**
I rarely overdo it now, and when I do, it's a reminder of how terrible I used to feel all the time. I find it hard to believe I was once so edgy, exhausted and in so much pain; always living on the edge of a crash. Of course, I still suffer pain, fatigue and many other symptoms, but they don't dominate my life to the extent they once did.
My experience with CFS has helped me to understand what I can control and what I can't. After living with CFS since 1995, I've concluded that I can't ultimately control the course of my illness. I think a fellow patient put it best when she said, "All I can do is give my body the best possible opportunity to heal itself, and then the results are out of my hands."
That's what pacing and looking after myself is all about - giving my body the best possible opportunity to heal itself. For me, having a sense of ‘control' is about knowing I can affect the course of my illness through my actions. I have the power to make myself feel better or worse. How I treat my body might not determine whether I recover, but it will determine how well I feel.
Releasing the idea I could get rid of this illness and focusing my energies on what I could do to feel better now was a powerful and life-changing experience. I had to let go of the idea that I could control my own body, and let it lead me instead.
I had to employ all of my creativity and determination to change the way I did things. In this way, I found freedom from CFS and the strength to live a disciplined life. |

# Pacing | Treating CFS & FM

|
Many people with CFS and FM find themselves caught in repeating cycles of push and crash, swinging between overactivity and forced rest. When their symptoms are low, they push to get as much done as they can. But doing too much intensifies their symptoms and they crash.
Pacing offers an alternative, a way to live a more stable and predictable life by knowing and staying within limits. With pacing, you can live your life according to a plan, rather than in response to symptoms, so you have a sense of managing your illness, rather than illness controlling you.
The benefits of pacing include:
- Lower symptoms
- Less suffering
- More stable and preditable life
- Sense of control

Pacing can help you reduce the suffering that results from overdoing, called Post-Exertional Malaise or PEM.The key fact about PEM is that the amount of rest needed to recover from overdoing is out of proportion to the overactivity, a punitive price even for small mistakes.
Dr. Lapp talks about a person having a certain number of "energy dollars" to spend each day. A healthy person might get $100, but the average person with CFS or FM is likely to have something like $25. If they spend $30, they are in the hole by $5, but in addition get assessed a $20 PEM "penalty fee" for overdrawing their account. They have to deposit $25 in the form of forced rest to get back to zero.
This section walks you through the nuts and bolts of pacing, beginning with how to define your limits and continuing on through how to minimize relapses. Each of the six parts in this section includes a worksheet plus our suggested first steps.

# Relationships | Treating CFS & FM

|
Serious illness creates stresses for most relationships. Relations with family, friends, coworkers, boses, and even doctors are altered in ways that crreate new challenges both for people with CFS and FM, and for those around them.
Frustrations for people with CFS and FM include:
![](uploads/image/tick.png) |
**Feeling Not Understood: **Other people may not believe you are ill or may not understand the seriousness of your condition.
|
![](uploads/image/tick.png) |
**Loss of Relationships:** Limitations and unpredictability of symptoms can make it difficult to maintain relationships. Some relationships may be lost, while others are redefined.
|

**Guilt: **You may blame yourself for getting sick or for not contributing to family or society.
|

**Feeling Undependable:** Unpredictability of symptoms often leads to cancelling out of commitments, creating misunderstanding and threatening some relationships.
|

# Self-Appraisal | Treating CFS & FM

|
The treatment plan you create should be one that fits your unique circumstances. One way to understand your individual situation is by completing the brief exercises in this section. (We've provided a worksheet for this purpose on the right.)
When you have done the exercises, you will:
- Have an idea of the severity of your CFS/FM and how you compare to others
- Recognize medical conditions beyond CFS/FM that may explain some of your symptoms
- Identify problems created by CFS/FM and what you are already doing to cope with them
- Understand your unique set of resources and challenges

CFS and fibromyalgia are much more than medical problems. They have comprehensive effects, touching many parts of life. They increase stress, trigger strong emotions, and affect your ability to work and your relationships.
A plan for managing CFS and FM has to address all their effects, not just symptoms. This section focuses on two areas, offering strategies for controlling stress and managing emotions.

# Treating Symptoms | Treating CFS & FM

|
Even though there is so far no cure for either CFS or fibromyalgia, there are many ways to alleviate the symptoms of the two conditions. Treatments can reduce the effects of CFS and FM, bring greater stability, lessen suffering, and may lead to a higher functional level.
This section describes treatment options for the four most prominent symptoms of CFS and fibromyalgia:
- Fatigue
- Pain
- Unrefreshing sleep
- Cognitive problems (brain fog)
Many authorities believe that starting with sleep is often the best approach, so we will begin with that symptom, after discussing how your doctor can help you and how to create a treatment plan.
As you read through this section, you'll find that we believe that even though doctors and medications can help, your success in regaining control of your life will probably depend more on your willingness to adapt to CFS and/or FM than on anything a doctor does for you.

## menu-Your-New-Life-10.html

# Your New Life | Treating CFS & FM

|
This section might be better titled "Moving Beyond Loss to a New Life."
For many who have them, CFS and fibromyalgia create many serious losses, includinjg the loss of control over one’s body, loss of friends, and the loss of valued activites. People are often forced to give up their job and so lose income, companionship, and status. And frequently, people have to abandon their dreams, thus losing the future they had envisioned for themselves. In sum, they experience the loss of both the person they were and the person they had hoped to become.
This section discusses how to work through loss and how to build a new life.

## menubar-Achieving-Consistency-126.html

# Achieving Consistency | Treating CFS & FM

|
While many people with CFS and FM understand that staying within their limits would bring a higher quality of life, many find it difficult to do.
The idea of doing a similar amount of activity each day and also taking similar amounts of rest seems unachievable and the rewards --having a more predictable life, a lower level of symptoms and an increased sense of control-- beyond reach.
If you are in that situation, what can you do to increase your consistency in living within your limits? One way is to find support, whether it be a spouse, good friend, coach or groups like those offered by the [ME/CFS and Fibromyalgia Self-Help Program](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/online-courses).
Pacing consistently involves replacing one set of habits and routines with a new set. Doing so takes patience, discipline and effort, but you can make it doable if you focus on one thing at a time from the strategies and techniques described in the next two pages.

## menubar-Additional-Treatments-146.html

# Additional Treatments | Treating CFS & FM

|
The management of CFS and FM does not end with lifestyle change and symptomatic treatments. There are also supplements, advanced therapies and theoretical treatments.
First, some introductory comments. An old adage states, "An illness for which there are many treatments has no cure." The corollary is, "When there is no cure, there will be a multitude of treatments." The lack of a cure and the slow progress toward recovery can create desperation, which makes people vulnerable to the allure of unproven treatments.
For that reason, many succumb to misleading information about vitamins, supplements, nutraceuticals and other treatments. If these treatments worked, everybody would be getting better. The truth is that for every person who improves with alternative therapies, there are thousands who have failed to respond/improve. Healing is a process that comes from within and does not require us to spend inordinate sums of money or indulge in false hope.
That said, the treatments described in this section may be helpful to some people with CFS and FM.

## menubar-Addressing-Feelings-130.html

# Addressing Feelings | Treating CFS & FM

|
Feelings such as worry, frustration, sadness, and grief are common and understandable responses to long-term illness. They are a reaction to the changes, limitations and uncertainty brought by illness.
Because emotions are so common in long-term illness, managing them deserves a place in your self-management plan. There are two additional reasons to include managing emotions in your plan.
First, CFS and fibromyalgia tend to make emotional reactions stronger than they were before and harder to control. People often say they cry more frequently, get upset more easily or have more angry outbursts than before they were ill.
Second, emotions can interact with symptoms in a vicious cycle. For example, being in constant pain can trigger worries about the future. Worry leads to muscle tension, which, in turn, increases pain.
Like other aspects of CFS and FM, feelings can be managed. Some strategies mentioned on other pages of this site may be useful for managing the emotions triggered by CFS and FM.
For example, relaxation techniques can short-circuit the feedback effect in which symptoms and emotions reinforce one another. Also, changing your thinking using [Cognitive Therapy](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/changing-self-talk) may be helpful. This approach has been proven to be especially effective for treating anxiety and depression.
Another general approach is to identify those situations (and sometimes specific people) that trigger strong emotions and plan a strategy of response ahead of time. Often, avoiding or minimizing stressful situations can reduce emotions.
In addition to self-help measures, the management of emotions can include professional help. Emotions such as depression and anxiety can be caused or intensified by changes in brain chemistry and may be treated using prescription anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medications.
Also, counseling can be helpful. Talking with a therapist about the problems triggered by your illness does not imply that "it's all in your head." Rather, counseling offers help dealing with a difficult situation.
The next several pages lay out our suggestions for managing depression, anxiety, worry, frustration, anger, and guilt.

## menubar-Building-New-Support-133.html

# Building New Support | Treating CFS & FM

|
Whether you live with family or alone, having a support network is one of the key ingredients to living well with a long-term illness. Support can take many forms:
**Practical help**: Grocery shopping, housecleaning, driving, etc.
**Companionship**: Having someone to go to a movie with, etc.
**Acceptance**: Feeling believed when you say you are ill
**Understanding**: The sense that others know what you are going through
Some support will probably come from existing relationships, such as family and friends, but you can build new sources of support as well. The next two pages focus on support groups and classes, and professional support.

# Creating a New Life | Treating CFS & FM

Or it may be the enjoyment and satisfaction from keeping a garden, painting a picture or completing a crafts project. Or it may be the mental pleasure that comes from enjoying the beauty of nature or from reading a book or the spiritual satisfaction of meditation or prayer.

**5. Use Realistic Hope**: It’s a challenge to keep hope alive when faced with ongoing symptoms and limitations. The approach we recommend is called realistic hope or acceptance with a fighting spirit. It combines two apparently conflicting parts: acceptance and belief that improvement is possible.

Acceptance means acknowledging that life has changed. People with this attitude do not live as if they were well or search a miracle cure to restore them to health.


Rather, they accept that their lives are different than before, and that it is necessary for them to live differently, for now and perhaps for the long run. At the same time, they have a fierce determination to improve and a confidence that they can find ways to make their lives better.


This approach often brings tangible results. Dr. Lapp has observed that those people with CFS and FM who do well “share a positive attitude and a willingness to adapt.”


**Paths to Lifting the Burden of Mental Suffering**


In addition to reducing symptoms and increasing functional level, there is another kind of healing that some people with CFS and FM experience: a change in perspective.


JoWynn Johns wrote about this in an article titled What Recovery Means to Me (see: What Recovery Means to Me), when she said, "Gradually, I came to accept the idea that perhaps I never could go back to my old life." She replaced that goal with the idea of restoring quality of life through building a different kind of life than she had before CFS. "I apply the word 'recovery' to myself because I have regained a satisfying life.”


Some other people with CFS and FM say they prefer the person they are today to the one before their illness. One wrote, "Even though I grieve the loss of self, the new me is a kinder, gentler and more caring person." Others say that in some respects they have a better life today than before they were ill, with the ability to focus on what is important and more time for relationships.


And some find a way to reframe their life in a realistic, yet positive, way. One woman in the self-help program wrote, "I probably won't have the kind of life I thought I would. But whether or not I recover, I try to bring as much meaning as possible to my life now and to value the core qualities in myself that have not changed… I still make a difference to other people, and I can still contribute to their lives."


Finally, some people with CFS or FM find it helpful to look at their illness through the lens of gratitude. In her article The Healing Power of Gratitude (see: The Healing Power of Gratitude), Joan Buchman says that, for her, gratitude does not mean that she always looks at the bright side or denies pain and suffering.


Rather, gratitude is "appreciating what you have and making the most from it. It's about finding out that you have more power over your life than you previously imagined." (For a summary of research on gratitude, see the article: [Counting Your Blessings: How Gratitude Improves Your Health](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/counting-your-blessings-how-gratitude-improves-your-health).)

## menubar-Creating-a-Treatment-Plan-147.html

# Creating a Treatment Plan | Treating CFS & FM

|
Before we lay out treatment options for the main symptoms of CFS and FM, we offer an example of creating a symptom treatment plan by describing how Dr. Campbell created his approach to fatigue, the most persistent and disruptive symptom of his CFS.
He started by listing possible causes of his fatigue beyond CFS and then evaluating each one:
1. Activity level (overexertion)
2. Pain
3. Poor sleep
4. Inactivity
5. Stress
6. Depression
7. Poor nutrition
8. Medications
**Activity Level**
Activity level seemed the most crucial. There was an obvious connection between the amount of activity and fatigue, though the effects were sometimes delayed a day or two. Given the strong the connection between activity and fatigue, he reasoned that he might gain some control if he found a level of activity that his body could tolerate.
He then spent a lot of time determining his limits, adjusting his life to fit within them, and periodically trying small experiments to expand his activity level. (For more, see the chapters on pacing in his [recovery](http://recoveryfromcfs.org/) story.)
**Inactivity (De-conditioning)**
Beyond activity level, the other factor that seemed especially promising was inactivity. Even athletes become deconditioned if they stop exercising for even a brief time, so he believed part of his fatigue was due to his lower activity level and that the way to fight this was through exercise. He experimented to find the length and intensity of exercise that produced an aerobic workout without increasing his symptoms.
**Sleep and Pain**
Improving his sleep also seemed worth pursuing. He focused on maintaining good sleep habits such as having regular times to go to bed at night and to get up in the morning. He also made use of a wind down period in the evening, turning off the TV and stop using the computer at 9 pm.
A final factor he thought might be affecting his fatigue was pain: responding to pain by tensing up might increase fatigue. He added a regular relaxation procedure to his daily rests.
**Stress, Nutrition and Medications**
A year or so into his experience of CFS, he came to believe that stress was second only to overexertion as an intensifier of symptoms. As a result, he added both stress reduction and stress avoidance strategies to his management plan. Also, over time he came to recognize the role of emotions in CFS and incorporated self-management strategies to address that area.
Lastly, he assumed that the final two factors on his list of possible causes of fatigue didn’t apply to him. Since he had decided not to take medications to treat his CFS, he was not worried about fatigue due to drugs. And he believed his nutrition was adequate.
**Two Principles and a Strategy**
His approach to fatigue illustrates two principles of symptom management in CFS and FM. First, because a symptom can have multiple causes, it’s often helpful to use multiple strategies in response. And, second, finding what works often takes experimentation.
To create your symptom management plan, we suggest you work on one symptom at a time, beginning with the one that is most bothersome. To proceed, list and evaluate your options. Settle on one or two and try it or them, then evaluate the results. Based on the results, refine your strategies or try new ones.

## menubar-Define-Your-Life-Situation-114.html

# Define Your Life Situation | Treating CFS & FM

|
Besides the severity of your CFS/FM and the presence of additional medical conditions, several other aspects of your life situation affect your chances for improvement.
One factor is the support you have. Some people with CFS and FM feel understood and supported by their family and/or other people in their lives, while others are challenged to have family understand them or may be alienated from their family.
A second important area is your financial situation. Some with CFS or fibro find their financial situations have changed little since they became ill. Others, however, are less fortunate. Lacking adequate money intensifies stress, and may make it difficult to access to medical care, adequate food and housing.
A third aspect of life situation is stability. Some people with CFS and FM are able to stay in the home they had when they got ill and their family situations are stable. Others have to deal with several to many changes. Stability makes improvement easier.
Finally, your situation includes two other significant factors that affect your chances to improvement: your coping skills and your attitude, both of which can be changed. Research has shown that people can learn effective skills for managing long-term illness, by adapting to their new circumstances through making adjustments to their daily habits and routines.
The attitude that seems to help is one that is both realistic and hopeful. We call it *acceptance with a fighting spirit*. People with this attitude sccept that their lives have changed and that they have to live differently. At the same time, they have confidence that they can find ways to improve.

## menubar-Expanding-the-Envelope-149.html

# Expanding the Envelope | Treating CFS & FM

|
If you live consistently within your limits, it is often possible to expand them, so that you are able to be more active without intensifying your symptoms. Your chances of success in this step are improved if you follow two guidelines:
- Extend your limits a little bit at a time
- Return to your previous level if symptoms increase
A “little bit” typically means no more than 5% to 10%, often less. The second guideline is based on the recognition that with all experimentation, some attempts work and others don’t, so we need a plan for the times when the experiment fails. In this case, failure means that extending limits results in an increase in symptoms. The response is to return to the old, proven-safe activity level.
We sometimes phrase this third part of pacing as “extend your limits, as allowed by the body” or “increase your activity in small increments, as tolerated by the body.”
**Four Success Stories**
To give you concrete ideas on how to expand your envelope, we suggest you read the Success Stories  (see: Success Stories)on this site. You'll find below summaries of four of those stories, told by people who made significant improvement using lifestyle change.
There are a number of strategies that appear in their accounts:
- Keeping a daily health log
- Taking daily rests
- Aiming for consistency in activity level
- Focusing on gradual change
- Using experimentation
- Managing stress
**Rosemary**
Rosemary Rowlands wrote about her improvement in the article Third Time’ Is the Charm: How I Learned to Pace Myself.  (see: Third Time Is the Charm: How I Learned to Pace Myself)Her article describes how she reversed a 20-year decline in her health that had left her housebound.
In her first attempt to learn pacing, she stopped working and took a long rest each day but otherwise didn’t change from her previous push and crash approach. In her second attempt, she focused on having the same amount of activity and the same amount of rest each day.
In her third phase, she worked on having a more consistent daily routine. Her efforts focused on “keeping records, making detailed daily and weekly schedules, resting frequently throughout the day, reducing daytime sleeping and spending less time in bed, being consistent in living by my schedule, and making changes gradually.”
Summarizing the results, she wrote, “Pacing has given me a way to make consistent, achievable changes in my life. I have increased my activity level by about 50% and I need less rest…. It took a lot of time and work to get to this point, but I’ve managed to stop and even reverse the trend of over 20 years of illness.”
**Dean**
Dean Anderson's approach was similar to Rosemary's, even though his starting and ending points were different. He functioned initially at a level corresponding to about 60% of normal and worked three-quarter time. (He describes his journey in the article Acceptance, Discipline & Hope: A Story of Recovery from CFIDS (see: Acceptance, Discipline & Hope: A Story of Recovery from CFIDS).)
He writes that the key to his recovery was to adopt an attitude that he called a particular kind of acceptance, which was not resignation but rather "an acceptance of the reality of the illness and of the need to lead a different kind of life, perhaps for the rest of my life."
He stressed the importance of consistency, saying he believed that the key was "to recognize and adhere to one's known limitations and to follow a strict regimen without periodically lapsing.”
His approach included keeping a daily health journal, eliminating negative influences (both people and attitudes), and “learning to be alone in silence,” which included living without television. A central element of his strategy was defining a safe level of work. Through experimentation, he concluded that he could work six hours a day without intensifying his symptoms.
After an eight-year struggle, he returned to full-time work and described himself as "substantially recovered."
**Elena**
Elena Rosen’s starting point was close to Rosemary’s, about 15% of normal. She rates herself at 98% now, similar to Dean’s final level. She has used a variety of strategies in her efforts to improve: experimentation, goal setting, record keeping, daily plans, and stress avoidance..
Summarizing her approach, she says in her article Using Targets to Improve Health and Gain Control (see: Using Targets to Improve Health and Gain Control) that in her first few years with CFS, she “tried to improve by making sweeping changes, an approach that always failed. Then I learned how to set small, realistic goals and that has made all the difference.
She gives an example by describing how she added exercise as part of her self-management. Her first exercise goal was to walk 1/16th of a mile every day at a very slow pace. (That’s about the length of a football field.)
Once a week, if she was having a good day, she extended the distance by ten or twenty feet, increasing the distance “as long as I experienced no increase in my symptoms.” Over time, she added a short rest in the middle of her walk. And the result? “Now, I walk two and a half miles virtually every day.” That’s 40 times her original distance.
**Kristin**
Kristin Scherger describes her improvement in an article titled Expanding My Envelope: How I Balanced Work and CFIDS (see: Expanding My Envelope: How I Balanced Work and CFIDS). When she became ill with CFS, she experienced a classic pattern of push and crash: “When my symptoms were strong, I would lie at home in bed for days. When I felt better, I would drag myself to work [as an occupational therapist] for several weeks before collapsing again and returning to bed.”
She tried working part-time, but she still experienced high symptoms and her life felt out of control. Next, she tried working as an on-call occupational therapist, but that was not successful either.
Logging convinced her that she was outside her Energy Envelope. She decided that if she didn't change careers to work that was less physically demanding, "I would never get off the roller coaster." She was able to achieve stability and expand her Energy Envelope by switching to an administrative position.
She wrote about her new, improved life: "My activity level and symptom level are now even better than those times a few years ago when I was not working at all." She rates herself at 60 on the Rating Scale most of the time and sometimes higher.

## menubar-Family-Issues-136.html

# Family Issues | Treating CFS & FM

|
CFS and fibromyalgia send shock waves through the family. Stress is increased, predictability is replaced with uncertainty, emotions are intensified and many practical aspects of life are altered.
Issues that family members face include:
- Extra household tasks
- Extra childcare responsibilities
- Financial strains
- Caregiving responsibilities (for person with CFS or FM)
- Worry and uncertainty about the future
- Uncertainty about how to help the person who is ill
- Resentment and frustration
- Sadness and depression
- Increased stress
- Loss of companionship
- Sexual difficulties
- Strained communication
- Less socializing
Family adaptation often focuses on the four issues described below. After reading about them, you can print and fill out the family Issues worksheet, and get our recommendations for next steps by clicking on the links to the right. (Issues for couples are discussed in the next section.)
**Redistributing Household Tasks**
CFS and fibromyalgia usually lead to a redistribution of household tasks such as shopping, cooking, cleaning, laundry, bill paying, and childcare. For those things the person with CFS or FM can't do or can't do in the same way as before, there are three main options: delegating, simplifying, and eliminating.
*Delegating *means finding someone else to do part or all of a task that the person who is ill used to do. Probably the most common solution is for the spouse to take over some or even many of the duties formerly done by the person who is ill. But there are other solutions as well.
If there are children living at home, they may contribute in various ways, such as by keeping their rooms clean, helping with meal preparation and doing their own laundry. If adult children live nearby, they may offer practical help as well. Another solution is to pay for help, for example by hiring a cleaning service on an occasional or regular basis.
*Simplifying *means continuing to do something, but in a less elaborate or complete way. For example, people may clean house less often or cook less complicated meals. Some people simplify by downsizing their home, for example, by moving from a house to a condominium.
Third, you may choose to *eliminate* some activities.
**Making Financial Adjustments**
The financial effects of CFS and FM vary greatly. Some families make no changes to their finances or only minor adjustments. This may occur if the ill person can continue to work, was not employed when she or he became ill or was at or near retirement. Some people are able to arrange an early retirement, though this may mean a reduced pension.
For other families, however, illness creates moderate to severe financial strain. If the person with CFS or FM is unable to work, family income may be reduced by half or more. A successful application for disability payments can reduce the deficit. (About 1/3 of the people in the self-help program report receiving disability benefits.)
Families also use several additional strategies in response to financial stress. When the person who is ill is able to work, their responses have included changing jobs to one with fewer hour, less responsibility or a shorter commute, and working from home. When working is not possible, people often file for disability.
Sometimes a healthy family member changes jobs to get work at higher pay or with better benefits. Some families establish financial discipline by using a budget and by reducing their spending. Others move to smaller, less costly homes, a strategy which can reduce both expenses and household tasks.
**Social Adaptations**
Because people with CFS and fibromyalgia have significantly less energy than before they were ill, they often reduce the time they spend with others, creating a loss of companionship both for themselves and for those around them. Factors such as energy limitations and sensitivity to sensory input (noise, light and movement) may force a reduction in the length, type or form of socializing.
For example, people with CFS or FM may have to limit their attendance at a child's school events or a family may rent movies rather than going to a movie theater. In sum, CFS or FM may reduce the time a person can spend with family, lead to changes in setting, and force families to focus on less physically and mentally demanding activities.
**Adjusting Expectations to a "New Normal"**
Underlying the many practical adaptations described above is a mental adjustment: accepting that life has changed on a long-term basis. This is sometimes called finding a "new normal" and it involves coming to terms with loss.
Family members lose some of the companionship they used to enjoy. They lose the future they envisioned for themselves and, like the person with CFS and/or FM, they are challenged to adjust to a different type of life than they had planned.
Coming to terms with loss and adapting to a new life usually takes several years or more. The end point of this process is acceptance, a complex attitude that includes recognizing that life has changed, accepting the limitations imposed by illness, adjusting expectations to match new capabilities, and working to improve quality of life.
Acceptance does not mean resignation, but rather a commitment to live the best life possible under the circumstances, recognizing that likely it will be a different kind of life than before. People report using four strategies to build a new life:
**Adjusting Goals to Fit Abilities**: Focusing on those things that are still possible, rather than on those that are no longer possible.
**Developing New Interests**: A powerful antidote to loss is the development of new interests and, from them, a new sense of purpose and meaning.
**Finding Positive Models**: People often report that their adjustment to CFS or FM was accelerated ondce they found other people who had adjusted successfully. Families can follow the same approach, seeking other families who can provide both practical ideas and models of successful adaptation.
**Developing Separate Interests**: Allowing the healthy spouse to develop his own interests and friendships can feel threatening, but there are benefits to the person who is ill.
As one person said, "At first, it can feel a little like the well partner is abandoning the sick partner, or at least moving away. But with time, the person with CFS/FM can see the positive side to their partner developing their own interests: the partner is happier and better able to be a caregiver, and the person with CFS/FM gets time alone to rest!"

# Fatigue | Treating CFS & FM

|
Fatigue is the central symptom in CFS and a significant problem for most people with fibromyalgia. Manifesting as listlessness and a reduced tolerance for exercise, fatigue can be brought on by low levels of activity or for no apparent reason. Fatigue is often much greater than and lasts far longer than it would in a healthy person ("post-exertional malaise").
Fatigue has many causes besides CFS and FM, including:
|
* *
|
*Overexertion *
|
|
Being too active, living “outside energy envelope”
|
|
|
*Pain *
|
|
Produces muscle tension, which is tiring
|
|
|
*Poor Sleep** *
|
|
Feel tired if sleep not restorative
|
|
|
*Inactivity *
|
|
Deconditioning from lowered activity level
|
|
|
*Stress** *
|
|
Stress creates worry and muscle tension
|
|
|
*Depression*
|
|
Low spirits produce sense of listlessness
|
|
|
*Poor Nutrition ** *
|
|
Lack energy if don’t eat well
|
|
|
*Medications*
|
|
Side effects include fatigue

Strategies for Fatigue
You can address fatigue by matching the strategies below to the causes you experience. For our suggestions on how to get started, click on the link in the box to the right.
**Pacing**
Perhaps the single most important key to controlling fatigue, and the other main symptoms of CFS and FM, is to adjust your activity level to fit your limits (pacing).
Pacing includes priority setting, rest breaks, short activity periods, switching between high and low intensity tasks and living by a schedule. Pacing also includes mental adaptation: accepting that life has changed and learning to live a different kind of life. For ideas on how to incorporate pacing into your life, see the section titled Pacing (see: Pacing).
**Treat Pain and Poor Sleep**
Treating these other symptoms using the strategies described in the sections on pain (see: Pain) and sleep (see: Sleep) produces the bonus of reducing fatigue at the same time.
**Exercise**
Exercise counteracts the fatigue caused by a lower activity level. For ideas on what you can do, see the page titled Exercise (see: Exercise).
**Managing Stress**
Using relaxation and other stress management strategies addresses fatigue by reducing worry and muscle tension. Managing stress also helps reduce pain and fog, and may improve sleep. For more, see the section on stress management (see: Managing Stress).
**Treat Depression**
One symptom of depression is fatigue, so treating depression can reduce fatigue. As with pacing and stress management, addressing emotions can improve several symptoms. For more, see the discussion of depression (see: Depression) in the section on emotions.
**Improve Nutrition**
People with CFS and fibromyalgia often have problems getting good nutrition. Severity of symptoms may make it difficult to eat well. Getting help, freezing meals on days with good energy and using prepared foods can help.
Also, many people with CFS/FM experience food sensitivities and food allergies. The most effective strategy for food sensitivities is an elimination diet, in which foods are taken out of the diet and then reintroduced one by one. For more, see the article [Nutrition and Chemical Sensitivity](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/nutrition-and-chemical-sensitivity) on the self-help program website.
**Check for Medication Side Effects**
Many medications, including some anti-depressants and drugs prescribed for pain, create fatigue as a side effect. To combat this source of tiredness, ask your doctor about fatigue when reviewing medications. A change of medication or a change in dosage may reduce fatigue.
**Consider Using Stimulant Medications**
Stimulant medications such as Nuvigil, Provigil, Adderall and Ritalin can help those who are sleepy during the day, as opposed to just tired. (Sleepy means falling asleep watching TV, reading, riding in the car, etc.)

# Finding Your Envelope | Treating CFS & FM

|
Finding and honoring the limits imposed by illness offers a way to gain some control and can lead to an easing of limits.
You got an overall idea of your limits, which we call the Energy Envelope, in the Self-Appraisal section, when you placed yourself on the [ME/CFS & FM Rating Scale](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/cfs-fibromyalgia-rating-scale) by asking "What is the highest level of functioning I can sustain without intensifying my symptoms?"
The average self-rating for people in the self-help program is 25 to 30. If that describes you, the amount of activity your body can tolerate at present would be about two hours a day. Your rating also gives you a baseline you can use to compare with later on.
**Defining Your Limits in Detail: The Little Envelopes**
While it is helpful to understand your overall limits, it's also useful to understand your limits in specific areas. We suggest you focus on the seven listed below, which are described in detail in the article [The Little Envelopes](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/the-little-envelopes) on the self-help program website.
- Physical activity
- Mental activity
- Social activity
- Sensory limits
- Stress
- Emotions
- Heart Rate
In each area, you seek to understand your limit in that realm and the cost in higher symptoms from going beyond your limits.
By zeroing in on each part of your life one by one, you can build a detailed understanding of your limits, which we encourage you to do by filling out the [Energy Envelope worksheet](uploads/PDF/Energy%20Envelope.pdf) after you read the rest of this page. For an example of defining the many envelopes, see the article [Finding Your Energy Envelope, Part 2](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/finding-your-energy-envelope-part-2) on the self-help program website.
(It’s OK to use estimates initially. You can replace them over time by focusing on one activity at a time and keeping a record of time spent and symptoms. For more on record keeping, see the discussion of [Logging](http://www.treatcfsfm.org/content-Logging.html).)
**Three Places to Begin**
Here are three strategies we recommend as you begin your work to understand your limits. (The first two are regularly recommended to patients at Dr. Lapp's clinic.)
1) Track Your Steps
To get an idea of your safe activity level, use a pedometer to count your steps as described in the article [Pedometers: A Tool for Pacing](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/pedometers-tool-pacing).
2) Track Your Heart Rate
Some people with ME/CFS and fibro are highly sensitive to their heart rate and experience relapses if the rate goes above a certain level called the anaerobic threshold (AT). See the article [Pacing By Numbers](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/pacing-numbers-using-your-heart-rate-to-stay-inside-energy-envelope) to find how to use a heart rate monitor to zero in on your AT.
**3) Define Individual Activity Limits**
A good way to understand your limits in particular areas is by trying experiments and keeping records, focusing on one specific area at a time and looking for how much you can do without intensifying symptoms. For ideas, see the [Logging](http://www.treatcfsfm.org/content-Logging.html) page.

## menubar-Fog-120.html

# Fog | Treating CFS & FM

|
Most people with CFS and fibromyalgia experience cognitive problems. Often called "brain fog" or "fibro fog," the problems include being forgetful, feeling confused, difficulty concentrating, problems with word recall and the inability to speak clearly.
Cognitive problems have a variety of causes, including:
|
* *
|
*Overexertion*
|
|
Being too active, living "outside energy envelope" |
|
|
*Fatigue*
|
|
It’s hard to be alert when tired |
|
|
*Poor Sleep** *
|
|
Some fog is created by not getting restorative sleep |
|
|
*Over-stimulation*
|
|
Too much sensory information or info from multiple sources |
|
|
*Multi-tasking** *
|
|
Doing more than one task at the same time |
|
|
*Stress*
|
|
Stress increases CFS/FM symptoms generally
|
|
|
*Medications*
|
|
Side effects include confusion and grogginess
|
Like the other major symptoms of CFS and fibro, brain fog is best addressed by using a combination of strategies and by developing new habits. You will find strategies for combatting fog on the next three pages. In addition, your efforts to control fatigue and poor sleep will help you control fog as well.

## menubar-Grieving-Losses-134.html

# Grieving Losses | Treating CFS & FM

|
Loss triggers the emotional reaction known as grief. While grief is usually associated with the death of a loved one, it can occur after any loss. Grief is often discussed in terms of fixed stages, but for most people, there is not a neat, orderly progression implied by the term stages.
Rather, grief is a more individual process in which a person may experience some emotions more than once or may feel two or more at the same time. Reactions can include denial, anxiety, frustration, guilt, loneliness, depression, self-pity, feeling abandoned and a sense of failure. Working through the grief triggered by CFS and FM often takes several years.
As descrubed on the previous page, the end point of grief is acceptance, which involves acknowledging that life has changed, realizing the need to live differently than before, and a willingness to build a new life.
Developing a self-management plan can ease the process. The use of pacing can increase control, thereby replacing uncertainty with predictability.
Pacing strategies, such as taking regular rests, help to stabilize life with chronic illness, reducing the swings between high symptoms and times of remission. Resting ahead of an event can make it more likely you can attend, thus counteracting the sense of not being dependable.
In addition to pacing, here are eight additonal strategies for moving through grief.
**1. Structure**: Having daily and weekly routines provides a sense of stability and familiarity. Routine also offers a distraction from loss.
**2. Problem Solving: **By addressing issues using practical strategies, you remedy the circumstances that triggered the emotions.
**3. Stress Avoidance:** Having to adjust to the many changes brought by illness can be traumatic. Sometimes it may be best to avoid people and situations that add more stress.
**4. Support:** Seek support from family, friends, and beyond. Others with CFS and FM can provide support and models of successful coping. Professional counseling can be useful.
** **
**5. Acknowledging Grief Triggers:** Grief reactions are often triggered by particular circumstances, such as anniversaries or by particular people. If your emotions intensify around the anniversary of your becoming ill or on other special dates, plan something positive for those times. If some people or situations make you feel anxious and uncomfortable, consider limiting your exposure to them.
**6. Acknowledging Loss:** Some people report they found it useful to make a public declaration of loss. One person in the self-help program, who wrote a Christmas letter to friends to explain why they hadn’t heard from him, found that writing the letter helped him accept his limits.
In the letter, he said, “I am sobered by the realization that it is highly unlikely that I will return to the level of functioning I had before and so will have to adjust to living a life with greater limits.” He reported that writing the letter helped him accept his limits and, paradoxically, increased his resolve to improve.
**7. Recognizing Grief as Cyclical and Long-Term:** You may experience several periods of grief as you move through the stages of life, for example if you remain single while friends marry or you remain childless while others become parents or if you can’t be the parent you had hoped to be or can’t have the career you trained for.
** **
**8. Addressing Self-Pity:** Almost everyone with chronic illness occasionally feels sorry for themselves. Given the losses and stresses of long-term illness, it's not surprising to feel overwhelmed by emotions from time to time. If you experience self-pity, you may counteract it various ways, such as the following:.
*Recognize self-pity is a part of serious illness*.
Just as symptoms wax and wane, so do emotions. Acknowledging that self-pity is happening can take some of its power away. You might say something like “Oh, there’s self-pity again.” Also, it can help to say consoling things like “I’ve felt this way before and it’s always blown over, so probably it won’t last this time either.”
*Rest*.
Strong emotions are sometimes triggered by fatigue and other symptoms. In those instances, rest may help alleviate both physical symptoms and emotions.
*Connect with others***.**
Reach out via phone, email or in-person. Sometimes just being in touch can change a mood. At other times it helps to have your mood acknowledged.
*Help others***.**
Shift your attention off yourself onto what you can do for your family, friends or others in your life.

## menubar-Managing-Stress-129.html

# Managing Stress | Treating CFS & FM

|
Stress management is an important part of managing CFS and fibromyalgia for two reasons. First, the two conditions add new stresses to your life, including ongoing symptoms, isolation, financial pressure, strained relationships, and uncertainty about the future.
Second, there is something about CFS and FM that makes people with them more sensitive to stress than before. It is as if the two conditions reset people's "stress thermostat", so that the effects of a given level of stress are greater than they would for a healthy person.
Stress is so common and debilitating that we recommend you use multiple techniques to manage it. A typical stress management plan might include a daily relaxation procedure, daily walks, taking regular rest breaks, having pleasurable activities every day, living by a schedule and avoiding noisy environments and negative people.
Our discussion divides this challenge into two parts: stress reduction and stress avoidance.
Next >> (see: Stress Reduction) |

## menubar-Name-Other-Medical-Issues-113.html

# Name Other Medical Issues | Treating CFS & FM

|
Living with CFS or fibromyalgia is often complicated by the presence of additional medical problems. Many people with CFS also have FM, and vice versa. Also, there are other conditions that are often found together with CFS and FM. (See list below.)
In addition, people with CFS and FM experience medical conditions common to aging, such as arthritis, back problems, cancer, diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure.
You may be able to reduce your overall symptom level by treating these other conditions.
**Overlapping and Related Conditions**
- Chemical sensitivity
- Depression
- Food and digestive issues: Candida (yeast infection), Celiac disease, lactose intolerance
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
- Irritable bladder syndrome (interstitial cystitis)
- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
- Migraine headaches
- Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS)
- Orthostatic problems such as neurally mediated hypotension (NMH) or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)
- Prostatitis
- Restless legs syndrome (RLS)
- Sleep apnea
- Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ)
- Thyroid problems

## menubar-Other-Symptoms-151.html

# Other Symptoms | Treating CFS & FM

|
Even though we have focused on treatment options for the four main symptoms of CFS and FM, people with the two conditions usually experience several or even many additional symptoms. Other common symptoms in CFS and fibromyalgia include:
- Abdominal pain (bloating, gas, diarrhea/constipation)
- Alcohol intolerance
- Allergies & rashes
- Anxiety
- Bruisability
- Chills or night sweats
- Chronic low back discomfort
- Depression
- Dizziness, lightheadedness or imbalance
- Dry eyes and mouth
- Fever
- Headaches
- Irritable or overactive bladder
- Jaw pain
- Loss of libido
- Lymph node tenderness
- Nausea
- Numbness or tingling in hands, arms, legs, feet or face
- Palpitations or shortness of breath
- Poor eye-hand coordination and dropping things
- Ringing in the ears
- Rosacea or worsening acne
- Sensitivity to light, sound, smell or weather
- Sore throat
- Twitching muscles or jerking
- Weight changes (gain or loss)
Additionally, about 70% of people with CFS experience **Othostatic Intolerance **(OI) in which symptoms worsen by sitting or standing for even short periods of time. Symptoms are ameliorated by lying down. OI may manifest as increased fatigue, weakness, nausea, abdominal pain, poor concentration, nervousness, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, headache, tremulousness, palpitations, and even faintness.

## menubar-Pacing-Strategies-124.html

# Pacing Strategies | Treating CFS & FM

|
To summarize what we've covered up to now, the first step in pacing is to find your limits or Energy Envelope. You got an overall understanding of your limits by placing yourself on the Rating Scale (see: Rate Your CFS/FM) in the Self-Appraisal section of the site and you may have extended that understanding by defining your limits in specific areas using the techniques described on the previous page.
Now we turn to the second step in pacing: adapting to the limits imposed by CFS and/or FM. This process, which can occur as you refine your understanding of your limits, is a gradual process, involving the use of multiple strategies, but benefits can come immediately from even a small change such as adopting one or two of the strategies you'll read about shortly.
Through experimentation, you can find the combination of strategies that works best for you from the strategies described on the next three pages.

## menubar-Pacing-vs.-Push-and-Crash-148.html

# Pacing vs. Push and Crash | Treating CFS & FM

|
If you have CFS or fibromyalgia, you are probably acquainted with the experience of push and crash. This is the frustrating loop in which people swing between overactivity and forced rest, feeling caught in the vicious cycle illustrated in the diagram.
When their symptoms are low, they push to get as much done as they can and the overexertion triggers an intensification of symptoms, which in turn leads to forced rest or a crash (Overexertion => Increased Symptoms => Rest). The high level of symptoms leads to the need for rest (the crash).
Resting is usually successful in reducing symptoms but then, frustrated by all they hadn’t done while resting, they plunge into another round of overactivity to catch up (Reduced Symptoms => Frustration => Overexertion), leading to another crash.
![The Push/Crash Cycle The Push/Crash Cycle](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/files/images/pushcrash.jpg)
The Push/Crash Cycle
Living in response to symptoms, they are caught in a vicious and often demoralizing cycle in which high symptoms alternate with periods of extended rest and their lives feel out of control.
**Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM)**
There is another, very important consequence of push and crash. Not only does overdoing produce an intensification of symptoms called Post-Exertional Malaise or PEM, but the intensification is out of proportion to the overdoing.
People with CFS and FM are in a doubly difficult situation. First, they have much less energy than healthy people (on average, about one quarter as much). And, second, activity beyond their limits triggers a disproportionate increase in symptoms.
It’s not unusual for an hour of extra activity to trigger a half day or more of bed rest and a higher level of symptoms that lasts a week. Going beyond limits for several days can lead to several weeks in bed and can reverse several months’ gains. In sum, even small amounts of overactivity can produce severe consequences.
**Pacing**
Pacing offers an alternative to repeated cycles of push and crash, namely the possibility of a more stable life. With pacing, you can live your life according to a plan, rather than in response to symptoms, giving you a sense of managing the illness, rather than the illness controlling you.
The benefits of pacing include:
- Lower symptoms
- Less suffering
- More predictable life
- Sense of control
- Less time spent resting (because less PEM)
- More productive use of time (because less PEM)
- Chance for improvement
Pacing has three parts:
**1 Finding Limits**
Fibromyalgia and CFS impose limits, which vary from modest to severe. Some are limits on physical activity, such as cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, shopping, driving, standing, exercise and work. But there are limits in other areas as well, including limits on mental activity, socializing, stress, and exposure to sensory information, food and other substances.
**2 Adapting**
The second part of pacing is adjusting one's life to fit within curent limits. Adjustment is a gradual process, involving the use of multiple strategies, as described on upcoming pages. The reward is reducing the suffering of Post-Exertional Malaise.
**3 Extending Limits**
If you pace consistently, you may be able to expand your limits, doing more without intensifying your symptoms. The keys to expanding limits are to extend them a little bit at a time and to return to your previoius level if the extension increases your symptoms.
**Summary**
The key point is that how you live your life with CFS and/or fibro has a big effect on your symptoms. Push and crash leads to a life controlled by fluctuations in symptoms. But by using pacing to find and adjust to your limits, you can reduce symptoms, regain a sense of control, and may be able to expand your limits.
How important is pacing? Here’s what Dr. Lapp said in a 2015 webinar for patients conducted by the CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention):
*I cannot emphasize enough how important pacing or limit setting is to the person with CFS/ME [or FM]. Pacing is more important than any medication, more than any supplement, more than Valcyte, or rituximab, or even Ampligen!*
Supplements only optimize one’s health. Medications only treat the symptoms, and there is no cure for CFS/ME [or FM] at this time. Years of experience have taught me that pacing and limit setting are key to improvement and recovery.

## menubar-Pain-118.html

# Pain | Treating CFS & FM

|
Pain is usually the central symptom in fibromyalgia and is often a problem for people with CFS as well. For people with FM, pain is generally felt all over the body, though it can start in one region and spread or move from one area to another.
It may be accompanied by neurological problems such as intermittent tingling and burning or numbness in the hands, arms, feet, legs or face. For people with CFS, pain may be experienced in the joints or, more commonly, as an overall body pain sometimes described as feeling like being run over by a truck.
Because pain in CFS and FM can have a variety of causes, it is usually managed with a variety of strategies, such as the following:
- Pacing
- Exercise
- Posture & movement
- Relaxation
- Addressing worry, frustration & depression
- Treating fatigue and poor sleep
- Heat, cold & massage
- Problem solving
- Distraction
- Healthy self-talk
- Medications
If pain is a problem for you, you can create a pain management plan from the approaches described on the next several pages.
|

## menubar-Planning-125.html

# Planning | Treating CFS & FM

|
Over time, you can gradually extend pacing to your whole life. A helpful tool toward this end is planning. By living your life according to a plan, rather than in response to symptoms, you can have a more predictable life, gain an increased sense of control over your illness, and may be able to expand your activity level.
We suggest you start by making daily plans (described on the next page (see: Daily Plans)) and then move on to weekly plans (discussed here (see: Weekly Plans)).
Next >> (see: Daily Plans) |

## menubar-Rate-Your-CFS_FM-111.html

# Rate Your CFS/FM | Treating CFS & FM

|
The severity of CFS and fibromyalgia varies greatly. Some people’s lives are touched lightly, while others have their lives disrupted moderately and still others are housebound or even bedbound. The bottom line: each person's illness is different. To treat your condition effectively, you need to understand the severity of your CFS and/or FM.
You can get an overall idea of the severity of your CFS or FM by placing yourself on the Rating Scale below. Place yourself on the scale by answering the question "What is the highest level of functioning I can sustain without intensifying my symptoms?" Your rating gives you an idea of the severity of your illness and of the activity level your body can tolerate at present.
For example, if you rate yourself at 30 (the high end of the average for people when they begin the self-help program), the amount of activity your body can tolerate at present would be about two hours a day. Your rating also gives you a baseline you can use to compare with later on.
Remember: whatever your current rating, we have seen people improve from where you are. More than 80% of people improve when they use the integrated approach offered on this site.

## menubar-Relapses-128.html

# Relapses | Treating CFS & FM

|
Times of intense symptoms, often called flares, setbacks, crashes or relapses, are a common and often demoralizing part of CFS and fibromyalgia. In addition to creating additional pain and discomfort, they can be deeply troubling, creating the worry that you will never gain control over your illness.
But there are things you can do to reduce their frequency and severity. Use the strategies in this section to lessen the impact of setbacks on your life.
Next >> (see: Limiting Severity) |

## menubar-Relationship-Strategies-131.html

# Relationship Strategies | Treating CFS & FM

|
Here are seven ways to improve your relationships if you have CFS or FM. After you’ve reviewed them, you can fill out the Relationship Strategies worksheet and get our recommendations for next steps.
**Assess & Triage**
Having a serious illness means you have less energy for everything, including relationships. This basic fact about CFS and fibro makes it likely that some or even many relationships will change and some will end.
This is one more example of how the limits imposed by illness force people to be selective and to set prorities. One response is to make this transition a conscious and deliberate process by using *relationship triage*.
You might think of your relationships as a series of concentric rings. In this scheme, the inner ring contains the most important people in your life, typically family and closest friends. People on the outer ring are casual acquaintances.
In between there may be one or two other rings of people with varying levels of importance. You may develop different approaches to people in various rings, concentrating on those in the inner ring.
The general idea is to concentrate on the more valuable or necessary relationships. In the words of Dr. David Spiegel of Stanford: “Save your energy and use the illness as an excuse to disengage from unwanted social obligations. Simplify the relationships that are necessary but unrewarding, and eliminate the ones that are unnecessary *and* unrewarding.”
**Educate Others (Selectively)**
Perhaps the most common relationship frustration among people with CFS and FM is not feeling understood. In our experience, attempts to educate others often require patience and are often (but not always) successful.
A woman in the self-help program was successful in educating her family using a pamphlet that explained CFS. One year, she gave copies of the brochure to her husband and adult children, asking that they read it as their birthday present to her.
Over a period of about a year, her family members came to accept her CFS. (For some examples, see the articles in the [Family and Friends](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/topic/family-and-friends) section of the self-help program website.)
Most people with CFS and FM eventually put limits on their efforts to educate others, focusing on the relationships that are most important and recognizing that some people may never understand or be sympathetic.
**Change Expectations and Use Assertiveness**
Because of guilt or pressure from others, you may do more than your body can tolerate and find yourself in a relapse. A solution is the combination of changing your expectations and being more assertive.
Changing expectations is a gradual process by which you come to accept that you have limits and need to adapt to a “new normal.” One person said that she used to say "I work until the task is done," but having fibro led her to change that to "I stop when tired." The new thought has led to new habits such as regularly taking rest breaks when doing chores.
Learning assertiveness can also be a gradual process, as you learn to advocate for yourself and set limits. One part of assertiveness is to be very specific in the requests you make or limits you set. For example, tell a caller "I have enough energy to talk for 20 minutes."
Second, show that you understand the other person’s situation. You might say something like, “I know my illness makes your life more difficult and that some things I say and do may be frustrating.”
Third, preface your request with a statement of appreciation, such as “I appreciate all you do for me.” Fourth, if you find it difficult to be assertive, practice saying your request to yourself or someone you trust before making it to the person whose help you want.
**Build New Sources of Support**
Creating new relationships can be a powerful antidote to the frustrations in relationships and can also counteract some of the losses and isolation brought by illness. One place to meet new friends is through support groups. Similar experiences are available now on the Internet, in online chat rooms and message boards, as well as through online classes.
In thinking about how to meet your practical and emotional needs, consider putting together a group of people who can help. Some may offer practical assistance, such as grocery shopping or driving. Others may be companions for outings. Still others may offer emotional support.
Professional help may be helpful as well. A sympathetic therapist can provide support and offer an outsider's view of your situation. If you're interested, you might look for someone who specializes in working with people who have chronic illness. Therapy can also be helpful for couples, offering a place in which the strains of living with long-term illness can be addressed.
**Adapt How You Socialize**
You may be able to preserve some relationships by adapting how you socialize. For example, if you have severe limits and cannot often get out of the house, you may be able to stay in touch with people using phone calls and emails, plus having people make occasional visits.
Another adaptation is to limit the length of socializing, for example by limiting how long you talk on the phone or the amount of time you spend face-to-face with others. A third adaptation is to alter the settings in which you socialize. You may be able to tolerate time in a restaurant if you go either before or after the busiest hours.
Other adjustments include limiting the number of people you socialize with (for example, two or three at a time rather than larger groups) and taking rest breaks. One woman with a large family told her married adult children that she would not host more than one couple and their kids at a time.
** **
**Do Your Part**
One step toward easing strains in relationships is to acknowledge that your illness creates problems for others. Your symptoms and moods, for example, may make you unpredictable, and your limits may force others to take on additional responsibilities.
Express your appreciation for their efforts. Acknowledge that the illness can make you unreliable. Out of respect for other people, warn them that you might have to cancel on short notice. To help maintain the relationship, tell them that you value them and that canceling a get together does not mean you don’t like them.
Take responsibility for the problems your illness creates for others. For example, if your illness makes you moody, make a list of things you can do to help yourself feel better so that you avoid inflicting your negative moods on others. Then, when you are feeling irritable, refer to your list and do something to change your mood, such as listening to music, taking a walk or having a rest.
As one person said, “I remind myself that relationships are voluntary and I ask myself what I can do so that other people will want to continue our relationship.”
**Accept Help and Help Others**
Other people often feel helpless about our illness. By giving them something specific to do, you can do them a service while helping yourself. As one person in our program said, “People are often thrilled when I ask for help in clear, practical ways.” A caution: asking too much of others in total or of one person in particular can risk caregiver burnout.
Helping others aids self-esteem and also gives others an incentive to stay in the relationship. As a person in the self-help program said, “I ask myself what I am doing to make a relationship valuable to the other person.”

## menubar-Responses-to-Loss-150.html

# Responses to Loss | Treating CFS & FM

|
Responses to loss are sometimes discussed as a sequence of stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. For most people, however, there is not a neat, orderly progression.
Rather, grief is a more individual process in which a person may experience some, but not necessarily all, of the responses just listed. Also, a person may experience some emotions more than once or may feel two or more at the same time.
**Denial and Disbelief**
A diagnosis of CFS or fibromyalgia often produces relief by giving a name to suffering, but this initial reaction may be accompanied by shock and disbelief. Common reactions include ignoring the diagnosis by trying to continue leading a busy life or seeking a cure by going from doctor to doctor or by trying special treatments or diets.
Denial can be an adaptive response, allowing time to adjust gradually to all that is different and to the uncertainty brought by serious illness. But repeated unsuccessful attempts to find a cure may reinforce a sense of helplessness and despair. Using self-management strategies can replace a sense of helplessness with experiences of control.
**Fear and Worry**
Fear and worry are common and understandable reactions to the unpredictability and uncertainty brought by illness. Not knowing what the future holds and experiencing a sense that life is out of control both produce tremendous anxiety. Developing and implementing a self-management plan can address worry in several ways.
The use of pacing, often in combination with medications, can bring stability, thereby replacing uncertainty with predictability. Also, because anxiety usually produces negative thoughts, changing self-talk to make it less fearful and more realistic reduces anxiety. In addition, meeting others who have learned to live successfully with CFS and FM can be a powerful way to dispel fear.
**Frustration and Anger**
Frustration and anger are common reactions to loss and the experience of having life changed by something over which you had no control. They are honest emotions that honor the recognition that life changed for no apparent reason, becoming much more difficult.
Feeling angry can have positive effects if it motivates you to work to regain control of your life or if it moves you to channel your energy toward helping others. But anger can be destructive if it is expressed by blowing up, shouting or by speaking cruelly. Such actions may drive away people who want to help or on whom you depend.
For people with CFS and FM, anger and frustration often manifest as irritability or crankiness. Gaining control over symptoms by strategies such as scheduled rests can reduce frustration and lessen episodes of irritability.
**Guilt**
You may blame yourself for becoming sick, saying things like "If only I had taken better care of myself." Guilt can be helpful if it motivates you to take better care of yourself from here forward, but it can be a trap if you see your illness as a personal failure. Whatever happened before, you can exercise control only from the present forward.
Guilt can also be useful in a second way, as an impetus to heal relationships. If we feel guilt because of harm done to others by actions under our control, we can respond by apologizing and making amends.
**Sadness and Depression**
Depression and feelings of sadness are common in chronic illness. They are natural responses to loss, uncertainty, limits and the discomfort of symptoms. Depression is a response that lessens further stress or trauma by slowing things down, allowing time to process what has already occurred.
Depression usually eases over time, but if not, several strategies may be helpful. First, self-help techniques can help you move forward, refuting the belief that all is hopeless.
Second, you can work to reframe your thoughts so that they are more realistic and hopeful. See the article [Changing Self-Talk](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/changing-self-talk).
Third, since a considerable number of CFS and fibromyalgia patients suffer from clinical depression, you may be helped by professional guidance and medications.
**Acceptance**
Working through loss often takes several years. The end point is acceptance, the recognition that life has changed, perhaps permanently and certainly for an extended period of time. Acceptance involves letting go of your past life and also of the future as you had envisioned it.
Acceptance also includes a realization of the need to live differently than before and a willingness to build a new life. This attitude was summarized by Dean Anderson, a person with CFS, who says in an article  (see: Acceptance, Discipline & Hope: A Story of Recovery from CFIDS)in the Success Stories section of this website that a certain kind of acceptance was the key to his improvement and eventual recovery.
He described it not as resignation, but rather "an acceptance of the reality of the illness and of the need to lead a different kind of life, perhaps for the rest of my life." To him, acceptance also meant finding ways "to be productive and [to] find fulfillment under unfamiliar and difficult circumstances."
Fibromyalgia patient Joan Buchman outlined a similar process of change in her article How I Created a Good Life with Fibromyalgia (see: How I Created a Good Life with Fibromyalgia), also posted on this site. She wrote that while she did not choose to have fibromyalgia, she did have a choice about how to live with it. She reduced her symptoms through making lifestyle changes and developed a fulfilling life by "focusing on my many blessings."
Dean and Joan both came to an acceptance of the reality of their illness and the need to lead a different kind of life. They found the key to improvement in the combination of accepting the illness and disciplining themselves to live in hope within the limits imposed by CFS or FM.

## menubar-Sleep-117.html

# Sleep | Treating CFS & FM

|
Poor sleep is an almost universal problem for people with CFS and fibromyalgia. Sleep problems include
- Difficulty falling asleep
- Frequent awakenings
- Phase shifting (hard to fall asleep until early morning hours)
- Over-sleeping (8 to 10 hours is ideal)
- Vivid dreams
- Feeling "tired but wired" (feel exhausted but mind is racing)
- Restless legs
- Periodic leg movements
Regardless of the number of hours slept, sleep is usually not restorative, meaning that people wake up tired rather than refreshed. (Even healthy people who are sleep-deprived experience fatigue, cognitive difficulties, irritability and muscle aches.)
Also, many people with CFS and FM experience dysania: fatigue, achiness and mental fogginess that lasts one to two hours after rising.
Addressing sleep problems is often a good initial focus for symptom management because treating sleep can both improve quality of life and reduce other symptoms.
Sleep management plans usually include a combination of strategies from three categories, which you will read about in the next three pages:
- Sleep environment and habits
- Medications
- Sleep disorders
If you are ready to create your plan for sleep, print and fill out the sleep worksheet (see link in box above, to the right). If you would like to read our suggestions for how to get started, click on the suggested steps link in the same box.

# Some Parting Words | Treating CFS & FM

|
Chronic illness has profound effects, changing every part of the lives of those who have them: how much people can do, their moods, their relationships, their finances, their hopes and dreams, and their sense of who they are.
We hope that even though you may not have control over the ultimate outcome of your CFS or FM, using this site has convinced you that there are many things you can do to improve your quality of life and your odds of increasing your level of functioning.
This site contains coping skills and strategies that can help you take responsibility for those things that are under your control. Many people in the self-help program and many of Dr. Lapp's patients have improved their quality of life and some have increased their level of functioning substantially using the ideas and strategies you found here.
We hope that by using what you found here, you can gain the ability to manage your illness better, creating the most favorable possible circumstances for your body's healing powers to carry you to whatever level of improvement is possible in your individual situation.
And we also hope that, even though you may not have the life you expected, you can build a good life for yourself nonetheless.

## menubar-Travel-and-Other-Special-Events-127.html

# Travel &amp; Other Special Events | Treating CFS & FM

|
Pacing is a challenge during normal times, but can be especially difficult for non-routine events, which include vacations, holiday celebrations, moving and remodeling, having dinner guests or houseguests or even, for some people, leaving the house for a doctor's appointment or just dinner out.
Such special events create a double challenge if you have CFS and/or FM. First, they require more energy than normal daily life. For that reason, they can pull you outside your energy envelope, intensifying your symptoms.
At the same time, you may want to be more active than usual or feel pressured by others to be more active, a second potential cause for a relapse. How can you enjoy such events and avoid a relapse?
We have found the three strategies described below are helpful in meeting the challenge of special events.
The success story (see: Family Visit Success Story) for this page describes the experience of a woman who used the strategies for a family visit. Previous visits had resulted in relapses that lasted several months. Using the three strategies, she experienced no relapse at all.
**1) Take Extra Rest: Before, During and After**
Perhaps the most widely-used strategy for making special events more successful is to get more rest than usual before, during and after the event.
Store up energy by taking extra rest before the event; limit symptoms by taking extra rest during; and take whatever extra rest is needed afterwards. The amount of extra rest will vary from person to person and event to event; twice as much as usual is common.
** **
**2) Plan in Detail**
The second strategy is to plan in great detail. If you are traveling, this may include planning your activities for each day of the trip, including rest breaks and alternate activities you can do if your energy level is not what you expect, and activities others can do without you.
Depending on the severity of your condition, you might also arrange for a wheelchair or motorized cart in airports. If you are going to a family event, it might mean finding out the schedule ahead of time and deciding how much activity you will have.
Your activity level and role will have to be adjusted to fit your energy level. For example, instead of doing all the cooking for a holiday celebration, ask family members to each bring a dish.
Or you might go to an event, but stay two hours, rather than the whole day or take periodic rest breaks. Travel can be made more doable by being less active than you used to be and by spending extra time resting.
**3) Discuss Your Plans with Others**** **
After deciding on your level of participation, discuss your plans with the other people involved in the event, so they know what to expect from you. You might also alert them to the possibility that you may need to cancel out or reduce your level of participation.
If you discuss your limits and the unpredictability of symptoms with others ahead of time, you can reduce the chances for surprise or disappointment and create a climate of flexibility.

## menubar-Your-Doctor's-Role-116.html

# Your Doctor's Role | Treating CFS & FM

|
If you are not able to access a provider who is an expert on CFS/FM, your next best bet is to find a doctor who is empathetic and willing to help. This person may be your existing primary care doctor or someone else you find who either knows about CFS/FM or is willing to learn about it.
There are four ways your doctor can help if you have CFS or FM:
1) Establish a diagnosis, if you aren't sure you have CFS or FM
2) Treat the major symptoms of the two conditions
3) Treat other conditions that often accompany CFS and FM
4) Provide usual primary care
While your doctor's role is important, you should recognize that there is no known cure so far for either CFS or FM, so there are limits to what your doctor can do. Medical treatment does not treat the disease; it only palliates the symptoms. The key to recovery in both conditions is acceptance of the illness and adaptation to it by means of lifestyle changes, for which medical treatment is no substitute.
**Four General Treatment Rules **
In considering medications and other treatments, there are four general rules that your doctor should follow:
- No medication works for everybody, so you and your doctor will probably have to experiment to find what works for you.
- People with CFS/ME and FM are extremely sensitive to medications (especially sedating ones), so your doctor should start with low doses and increase slowly. Start low, go slow!
- Multiple medications are often required to address the numerous symptoms of the two conditions. This “rational polypharmacy” is not unusual or unexpected, and should not deter your doctor from helping you. Your doctor is likely to make one change at a time, so you and she can determine the effectiveness and side effects of each medication.
- Your doctor may have to replace medications periodically, since it is not unusual for people with the two conditions to develop tolerance to medications.
For more, see Dr. Lapp's article on the self-help program website [How Your Doctor Can Help If You Have CFS/ME](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/how-your-doctor-can-help-if-you-have-cfsme).
Also, Dr. Lapp and other US doctors who specialize treating people with ME/CFS have created a six-page guide for primary care doctors to help them diagnose and treat people with ME/CFS. The guide can be read, printed and downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SG7hlJTCSDrDHqvioPMq-cX-rgRKXjfk/view).

# Dr. Lapp's Message  | Treating CFS & FM

|
There is no panacea, no magic potion for CFS and FM, but those who have overcome this illness invariably report that the techniques we will teach you helped them more than any pills or potions.
I know that you’re looking for some treatment you can take tonight and tomorrow you’ll wake up refreshed and renewed. I’ve got to be honest with you. I’ve been treating people with CFS/FM since 1985 and there is no magic.
I have polled those people who have overcome this illness and invariably they report that the techniques that Dr. Campbell and I will teach you on this website helped them more than any pills or potions.
What you’ll find here is the combination of the Stepwise Approach I developed many years ago with Dr. Paul Cheney and the tools taught in Dr. Campbell’s classes. This is the same integrated approach I now use with my patients. We have found that with encouragement, lifestyle changes, and targeted medications, more than 80% of people we treat can improve significantly.
Let me be clear about your part. Your doctor can help you cope with CFS/FM, but your success in regaining control will likely depend more on what you do than on anything a doctor does for you.
Medical treatments can help alleviate the symptoms of CFS/FM and further reduce suffering by treating other medical problems, but the key to recovery in CFS/FM is acceptance of the illness and adaptation to it by means of lifestyle changes.
If you adopt what we teach you on this website --which will require discipline, courage and lots of patience-- you can overcome the CFS/FM dragon. You can regain control, instead of your condition controlling you!

# Treatment Plans for CFS and FM | Treating CFS & FM

|
CFS and FM touch many parts of life: work, relationships, moods, hopes and dreams. Treating them successfully means much more than managing symptoms. A treatment plan has to address all their effects.
The challenge you face is complicated by that fact that besides having comprehensive effects on many parts of your life, CFS and FM interact with them. (See diagram.)
For example, CFS and FM reduce your activity level (arrow pointing out from CFS/FM to Activity), but your activity level affects your symptoms. If you do more than your body can tolerate, you will experience higher symptoms. But if you adapt to your limits, you can control your symptoms.
There are similar two-way effects between symptoms and other factors as well. Illness increases stress and stress makes symptoms worse, but by controlling stress, you can moderate symptoms.
Long-term illness often leads to depression and people who are depressed have a lower threshold for pain. Treating depression can affect both mood and symptoms.
In short, how you respond to CFS/FM has a big effect on symptoms and quality of life, often a larger effect than medical treatments.
You'll find our recommendations for medical treatment here, but our focus is on showing you how you can triumph over CFS/FM by adapting to it.
As Dr. Lapp says, medical treatments can help alleviate the symptoms of CFS/FM, but the key to recovery in CFS/FM is acceptance of the illness and adaptation to it by means of lifestyle changes.
Adaptation is an ongoing process that requires discipline and patience. |

# Success Stories | Treating CFS & FM

I tried almost every pacing strategy I heard of, but four proved crucial to my recovery: pre-emptive rest, logging, a consistent activity level and supportive self-talk.

I've had CFS for more than 20 years. My health declined gradually and was very poor by a few years ago. Since then, however, using pacing ideas from the self-help program and other sources, I've made steady progress and my life has improved greatly.

# Activity Adjustments | Treating CFS & FM

|
Part of pacing is changing how you are active. You can improve by integrating the following activity adjustments into your life. (For more detail on each strategy, see the [Pacing Tutorial](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/pacing-tutorial) and the series [Pacing: What It Is and How to Do It](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/pacing-what-it-is-and-how-do-it) on the self-help program website.)
**Putting Limits on Individual Activities**
One common pacing strategy is to set limits on particular activities. This can mean that you stop doing some things entirely or that you reduce the amount of time you spend doing an activity ("stop before your drop"). Activities often targeted include:
- Computer use
- Phone calls
- TV viewing
- Housework
- Standing
- Driving
- Shopping
- Exercise
- Times outside the house per week
To put limits on individual activities, follow a two-step approach. First, find your limits through experimentation. For example, try different lengths of time working on the computer, taking note of your symptoms during and after, then gradually adjust your computer sessions to fit within the limit you found. You might use a timer to enforce your limit.
For an example of limit setting, see Bobbie Brown's article The Many Reasons Why I've Improved (see: The Many Reasons Why I Improved). The article describes how she increased her functional level from about 15% of normal to about 35% or 40%.
** **
**Practice Activity Shifting**
Another strategy for getting more done with lower symptoms is to shift frequently from one type of activity to another, for example switching among physical, mental, and social activities. If you find yourself tired or confused after working on the computer for a while, you might stop and call a friend or do something physical like preparing food.
Another way to use task switching is to divide your activities into different categories of difficulty (light, moderate, and heavy), switch frequently among different types and schedule only a few of the most taxing activities each day.
**Use Short Activity Periods**
You can also affect your symptoms by adjusting *how* you are active. Two short periods of work with a break in between can produce more and leave you feeling less symptomatic than the same amount of time expended in one block. For example, you might do ten minutes of housecleaning, rest for five minutes, then do another ten minutes of cleaning.
The same principle can be applied over longer periods of time. You may find, for example, that your overall symptom level is lower if you spread activities through the week, rather than trying to do many things in one or two days.
**Use Devices**
Your efforts to pace yourself can be aided by using devices of various kinds:
**Pedometers and Heart Rate Monitors**
We'll begin with pedometers and heart rate monitors, two devices we recommended you use to find your limits. Both can be used also to help you adjust to your limits.
You can use a *pedometer* (step counter) to limit your physical activity. FIrst, determine your current activity limit by wearing it for several days, noting the connection between your number of steps and your symptoms. Then, knowing your limit, use the pedometer to stay within your limit. For more, see the article [Pedometers: A Tool for Pacing](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/pedometers-tool-pacing).
One trigger for relapses is a heart rate above a limit called the anaerobic threshold (AT). Some people with CFS and FM exceed their heart rate threshold with everyday activity. A *heart rate monitor* can help you determine and then stay below the threshhold. The article [Pacing By Numbers:: Using Your Heart Rate to Stay Inside the Energy Envelope](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/pacing-numbers-using-your-heart-rate-to-stay-inside-energy-envelope) will show you how to determine determine your AT. Knowing your threshold you can use a monitor to stay below it.
**Timers**
You can use timers to enforce activity limits. For example if you know that 15 minutes is the longest you can work on the computer without getting fatigued or brain-fogged, use a kitchen timer or the timing function on a watch, cell phone or computer to set the timer a short time before your limit.
**Stools, Scooters and Other Devices**
If you often feel faint while standing, consider sitting down whenever possible, for exampe use a stool while preparing meals or a plastic chair while showering. Similarly, if shopping is tiring, use a scooter or motorized cart. Use wheelchairs in airports and a cane for balance, grab bars in the bath, and handicap parking tags to park close to your destination..
**Use the Rule of Substitution (Pigs at a Trough)**
It's easy to do just "one more thing", but that approach often leads to higher symptoms. The solution: think of substitution rather than addition. In order to add a new item to your schedule, drop one.
For example, if your Enveope allows you to leave the house three times a week and something new arises, find a way to postpone one of the usual outings in order to honor our limit of three. The new activity squeezes in by forcing another activity out, just like pigs at a trough.
**Delegating, Simplifying, and Eliminating**
The overall idea of pacing is to reduce your overall activity level so it fits without your limifs. You can think of this as a two-step process. First, you determine how much pruning you'll have to do. For example, you can list the activities you do currently in a typical week, making an estimate of the time each takes.
You then add up the times and compare them with the limits you established using the Rating Scale from the Self-Appraisal  (see: Rate Your CFS/FM)or the Energy Envelope form from the Finding Limits (see: Finding Your Envelope) page. If the items on your list take more time than your limits allow, you will have to make some adjustments to stay inside your limits.
In the second step, you reduce your activity level using a combination of delegating, simplifying, and eliminating. *Delegating *means finding someone else to do a task that you used to do. For example, have other family members do the grocery shopping or hire a cleaning service.
*Simplifying *means continuing to do something, but in a less elaborate or complete way. For example, you might clean house less often or cook less complicated meals. Finally, you may decide to *eliminate *some activities entirely.

# Additional Strategies | Treating CFS & FM

|
Many people with CFS and FM make use of some or all of the following additional pacing strategies.
**Pay Attention to Time of Day**
Most people with CFS and FM find they have better and worse times of the day. For some, mornings are good, while others perk up later in the day. It’s likely you can get more done, without intensifying your symptoms, by changing *when* you do things, so that you use your best hours for the most important or most demanding tasks.
One person in our program wrote about exercise, "If I walk in the evening, I can make it around two blocks, but three has me collapsing. Early in the day, I can do three or more. I have a window between 8 and 11 in the morning that is best for most activity, both mental and physical."
A person with brain fog who was studying for a professional exam found that she could read for twice as long and remember what she read much better if she studied during the afternoon, her best time. Experimenting with time of day enabled her to increase her study time greatly while also increasing her comprehension and thereby helping her pass the exam.
** **
**Control Sensory Input**
Many people with CFS and FM find their concentration is affected by having too much sensory input, especially light and sound, or experiencing input from multiple sources at the same time. The solution: focus on one thing and simplify your environment.
For example, you may have a better understanding of what you read if your turn off the TV while reading or move to a quiet place. If noisy restaurants bother you, try visiting during non-peak times. For more, see [Sensory Overload: Sources and Strategies](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/sensory-overload-sources-and-strategies), one of the most popular articles on the self-help program website.
**Keep Pleasure in Your Life**
Living with a chronic condition means experiencing ongoing discomfort and frustration. Pleasurable activities reduce frustration and stress, distract you from your symptoms and give you things to look forward to. For all these reasons, enjoyable experiences make it easier to live within your limits.
Examples include taking a bath, having a conversation with a friend, listening to or playing music, seeing a movie, spending time in nature, and reading. All can be considered pacing strategies because having enjoyable experiences makes it easier to accept and live within limits.
**Make Mental Adjustments**
Pacing means adopting new habits, but it also requires making mental adjustments rooted in an acceptance that life has changed. This acknowledgment leads to a different relationship to the body, described by one person as “a shift from trying to override your body’s signals to paying attention when your body tells you to stop or slow down.”
One part of this shift is changing our internal dialogue (self-talk) and expectations, so that they support our efforts to live well with illness rather than generating guilt.
One person in the self-help program says that she used to think she was lazy when she took a nap. Now when she rests, she tells herslef, "I am helping myself to be healthy. I am saving energy to spend time with my husband and to babysit my grandchildren." Another example is the article [Making a NOT TO DO List](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/library/making-a-not-to-do-list).
** **
**"Simple But Not Easy"**
What one person in the self-help program said about the program is a good summary of the challenge of self-management: "What this program teaches is very simple, but not easy."
The essentials of pacing can be described in a few words: find your limits, adapt to limits, then expand activity carefully.
But pacing is also very challenging: living well with CFS or FM requires that we change our thinking and how we live our lives. This change is gradual and requires hard work, patience, and courage.

# Advanced Therapies | Treating CFS & FM

|
Some patients who suffer recurrent infections or viral symptoms may benefit from transfer factor or isoprinosine, which are thought to reduce viral load and possibly moduate the immune system. When gamma globlin or IgG subclasses are low, intravenous or subcutaneous gamma globulin has been helpful
The research literature supports the use of growth hormone and low dose cortisol in many people with CFS/FM whose hypothalamic-pituitary –adrenal axis (HPA axis) is suppressed by their illness. That is, the hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenals, and other glands (such as the thyroid and sex glands) function poorly.
The poor functioning would be evidenced by low levels of DHEA-S, IGF1 (a measure of growth hormone), estrogen (in females), testosterone (in males), morning cortisol or 24-hour urinary cortisol production. In such cases, the use of hormones and steroids may provide modest benefit.
Lastly, Ampligen is an immune modulator that has been under study since 1988 for the treatment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. The manufacturer, AIM Immunotech, is currently seeking FDA approval for the use of this drug in CFS. It is an investigatioal drug only available at the the Hunter-Hopkins Center (Charlotte NC) and Dr. Dan Peterson’s clinic, (Lake Tahoe NV) as part of an experimental protocol.

# Anxiety &amp; Worry | Treating CFS & FM

|
Given the uncertainties triggered by CFS and FM, it’s not surprising that anxiety and worry are common reactions.
Self-management strategies such as those below are often helpful, but you might also consider professional help and medications. Counseling and therapy can make worries more manageable.
Also, anxiety, like depression, can have a physical basis in the biochemistry of the brain. If so, medication may help. A drug will not be a complete solution to problems of anxiety, but it can be part of a comprehensive response.
Here are nine sets of strategies that are often helpful in counteracting anxiety and worry.
**Use Relaxation & Other Stress-Busting Tools**
Learning relaxation and other stress reduction techniques (see: Stress Reduction) helps reduce the intensity of your emotional reactions and, by doing so, reduces the echo effect in which emotions and symptoms amplify one another.
A regular stress reduction practice can also lower "background worry," the ongoing anxiety that results from long-term stress. For step-by-step instructions, see the article [Stress Reduction: Five Practical Techniques](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/stress-reduction-five-practical-techniques).
**Use Problem Solving**
Taking action to solve a problem has a double payoff. You reduce or eliminate a practical concern that is bothering you and the process of taking action reduced anxiety, replacing it with a sense of control and power.
**Change Your Thinking**
If you have a tendency to think of the worst that might happen, you can take steps to short-circuit the process in which your thoughts increase your anxiety.
One antidote is to retrain yourself to speak soothingly when worried, saying things like “I’ve been here before and survived” or “this is probably not as bad as it seems.”
Also, you can do “reality checks” by testing your fears against facts and by asking for feedback from others. You can make worry work for you if you learn to disginguish between toxic worry, which is unproductive and paralyzing, and good worry, which helps you plan.
For more on changing thinking, see the article [Changing Self-Talk](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/changing-self-talk) on the self-help program website.
**Write to Reduce Worry**
Write out what you're worried about. The process of giving words to worry can put them into perspective and may even help you identify potential solutions. If you tend to get stuck in rumination, consider writing a reassuring letter to yourself that you can read when you feel stuck.
**Stay Connected**
Simple human contact is often very soothing. Calling a friend or getting together to talk, share a meal or see a movie counteracts isolation, preoccupation with problems and the low mood often associated with chronic illness.
**Exercise**
Exercise is one of the best treatments for worry, because it is both relaxing and distracting. It relieves tension, lessens stress and improves mood. For how to exercise safely when you have CFS or FM, see our page on exercise (see: Exercise).
**Pursue Pleasure**
Pleasurable activities offer a distraction from symptoms, counter anxiety, and help create a good mood. Such activities might include reading, music, games or spending time with friends. These activities and others in which you become immersed, help you to change your mood.
**Don’t Worry Alone**** **
The act of sharing a worry almost always reduces its size and emotional weight. Discussion may help you find solutions and almost always makes the worry feel less threatening.
Putting a worry into words translates it from the realm of imagination into something concrete and manageable. Seek out people who can offer support and reassurance.
**Consider Counseling and/or Medications**
Counseling and therapy can make worries more manageable. Also, just as drugs can help with depressio, some people find that medications help them deal with anxiety.

The act of sharing a worry almost always reduces its size and emotional weight. Discussion may help you find solutions and almost always makes the worry feel less threatening.
Putting a worry into words translates it from the realm of imagination into something concrete and manageable. Seek out people who can offer support and reassurance.
**Consider Counseling and/or Medications**
Counseling and therapy can make worries more manageable. Also, just as drugs can help with depressio, some people find that medications help them deal with anxiety.

# Better Communication | Treating CFS & FM

|
The stresses brought by serious illness can make good communication difficult. To complicate matters, CFS and FM bring the additional challenge of cognitive problems. Here are seven ideas for improving communication if you or your partner have CFS or FM.
** **
**Pick a Good Time and Setting**
If you have something important to discuss with a significant person in your life, select a time when both of you will be at your best. It should be a time when both of the person with CFS or FM can give good attention and won't be distracted by pain or brain fog, preferably during his or her best hours of the day. Choose a place that minimizes distractions and interruptions.
** **
**Practice Good Listening Skills**** **
Good communication is based on each person understanding the other person's views. Understanding begins with listening, which means focusing your attention on what is being said, with the goal of understanding the speaker's point of view. Listening works best if it occurs without interruption.
** **
**Focus on One Thing at a Time and Be Specific**
Focus on one issue at a time. If you are requesting that the other person change, be specific in your request. Avoid making general requests such as, "I need help with the housework." Instead, say something like, "Can you do a load of laundry today?" or "Can you do the grocery shopping?"
** **
**Aim for Solutions**
Have as your goal finding solutions, not blaming one another or finding fault. It may be helpful to remember that the illness creates problems for both of you. The idea is to be able to discuss problems in a constructive rather than a confrontational way. Treat each other with respect, acknowledging his or her support and effort. Avoid demeaning comments, sarcasm and blaming. Acknowledge your part in shared problems and express appreciation for the other's efforts.
**Use Problem Solving**
Use problem solving to find solutions. Begin by brainstorming, which means thinking of a variety of possible ways to solve a problem. Then evaluate each proposed solution, decide which ones are most promising and try one or two of them.
Third, after giving each solution a fair try, evaluate the results. Some potential remedies may not work, so you may need to have further discussions and try other solutions. The final solution may be a combination of several approaches.
** **
**Consider Getting Help**
In many cases, you will be able to solve your problems yourself, but at times you may want to get help, either in understanding the causes of your problem or in finding solutions. So it may help to ask what resources are available to you.
For example, to get a fresh perspective on your situation, you might ask other families how they have solved a similar problem. Also, if conversations about your problems are not productive, you can consider getting professional help. A counselor can facilitate a solution to particular problems and also help you practice good problem solving skills.
** **
**Have Regular Problem Solving Discussions**
Set aside a regular time for relationship discussions. One couple in the self-help program sets aside Sunday evening as their time to discuss any issue on either person's mind, calling it their "talk night."
Having scheduled time for discussion means that both husband and wife know that they have a forum in which to state problems and frustrations, and a means for finding solutions. Also, because the talks are frequent, they can refine their communication skills through regular practice.
The husband explains, "Anything either of us sees as a problem or causing stress is a likely topic. Even very minor things are OK." Topics include an issue one has with the other, problems with friends or children or problems around the house.
He says, "a rule is the we each openly listen to the other without being defensive. We problem-solve together to come up with a resolution for each issue. After doing talk night we start each week refreshed and with the feeling that comes from having dealt with whatever problems were there."

## submnu-Daily-Plans-105.html

# Daily Plans | Treating CFS & FM

|
A daily schedule gives you a way to translate your understanding of your capabilities and limits into a daily routine of activities and rest.
Each morning or, even better the night before, list possible activities for the day. (Be sure to include rest periods as part of your schedule.) Then evaluate your list, asking whether you will be able to do everything on it without intensifying your symptoms.
One way to make the list realistic is by applying the 50% rule: prioritize the items on the list, then aim to do only the top half. Another approach is to look over the list and identify items that can be postponed, delegated or eliminated.
When you plan your day and live your plan, your symptoms are likely to come under better control and you may be tempted to do more. This temptation is part of the push and crash cycle that you are trying to break.
The goal is to have a consistent level of activity that you can sustain over a week or more, a very different way of living than the cycle of push and crash.
The person featured in the success story for this page uses a daily schedule to maintain consistency in her life, with similar amounts of activity and rest each day. She reports that her efforts resulted in an increase in her activity level of about 50% over a two year period and that she now needs less rest.
For further instructions on how to create a daily schedule and an example, see the chapter on [planning](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/library/10-pacing-lifestyle) in the the text for the self-help program’s introductory course. For another sample schedule, see below.

## submnu-Depression-94.html

# Depression | Treating CFS & FM

|
Depression is common in people with CFS and fibromyalgia. Some of the depression is situational, a reaction to the limits, disruption, losses and uncertainty brought by long-term illness. Self-management strategies are usually helpful with this type of depression.
Depression may be biochemical as well, created by changes in the functioning of the brain. Self-management strategies may be useful for this type of depression, but treatment for biochemically-caused depression normally also includes medication.
You'll find self-management strategies below, but if you are seriously depressed, suicidal or have been depressed for some time, get help now. Phone a suicide prevention center, talk to your doctor, see a psychologist or call a friend. For resources, see the article [Killing Me Softly: FM/CFS and Suicide](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/killing-me-softly-fmcfs-suicide) on the self-help program website.
If your situation is not urgent but depression reduces your ability to do your normal daily activities, we suggest you consider professional help: counseling, medications or both.
A therapist can provide an outside view of your situation, help you to accept your illness, and support you in your efforts to improve. If you have family tension because of illness, couples or family counseling may be helpful.
**Planning for Depression**
Everyone has times when they feel unhappy or sad. By recognizing that these feelings are likely to occur from time to time, you can plan how to respond. Here's a menu of options:
** ****Be Active**: Depression produces hopelessness, an attitude that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Doing something constructive changes mood and counteracts those feelings. For an example, see "Two Special Anti-Depression Strategies" (below).
**Stay Connected**: Supportive human contact is very soothing. Time with positive people counteracts isolation and preoccupation with problems. Contact can be as simple as a phone call or an exchange of emails. Conversely, reaching out to help others and getting involved with something larger than yourself are other ways to counteract isolation and preoccupation with self.
**Consider Medications**: If your depression is biochemical in origin, you may be helped by an anti-depressant medication. On the other hand, tranquilizers and narcotic painkillers intensify depression, so if you are depressed, it may be due partially to a medication side effect.
**Use Positive Self-Talk**: If you have a tendency to think of the worst that might happen, you can retrain yourself to speak soothingly and realistically when you’re worried or depressed. For example, remind yourself when you’re feeling low that periods of bad feelings end. For a detailed explanation, see the article [Changing Self-Talk](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/changing-self-talk) on the program website.
**Maintain a Schedule: **Keeping to a daily routine regardless of how you feel can help counteract depression. Forcing yourself to do things, even if you don’t want to, counteracts the inertia of depression. Also, maintaining your usual self-management strategies helps minimize symptoms, taking away a possible additional source of depression.
**Do Something Pleasant**: Pleasurable activities offer a distraction from symptoms and help create a good mood. The key is to find things that will absorb your attention. Such activities might include reading, listening to music, sitting in the sun, taking a walk, doing crafts, solving puzzles, watching a movie, and spending time with friends.
**Keep a Gratitude Journal: **Some people find it helpful to keep a journal in which they note positive notes every day. Over time, they find that their attitude toward their illness and their life changes in a positive direction. For a personal story, see the article The Healing Power of Gratitude (see: The Healing Power of Gratitude).
**Two Special Anti-Depression Strategies**
One person has created two special strategies she uses when depression hits. The first, called "The Treasure Box of Plesantries," is a notebook containing compliments she has received, photos of places she has visited, plus treasured notes, photos and cards. When her mood is low, she picks it up by going through the box.
Her second strategy, "The 100 Hours Program," is a script of up to 100 hours of "every special, pleasant and meaningful activity I can think of." It's all worked into a schedule she keeps in a binder. She says, "I don't think 'what do I do now?' I've planned it all our beforehand."
**Letter to Myself**
Another person has written a "letter to myself," which she can read when depresson hits and temporrily clouds her judgment.
It begins, "I am writring to you from a peaceful place of acceptance, but I remember very clearly what it was like to be gripped by fear and isolation. I am writring this in the hope that I can inspire you to retain (or regain) a clear connection to the insights and tools which can help you to avoid being sucked down into the swamp again."
She goes on to challenge herself not to give in to self-pity and she reminds herself in detail of what has helped her thought difficult perods in the past.
She concludes, "I hope you will choose faith and hope and ilfe. I hope you will choose to reach deep inside yourself to access all of those decades of growth and learning. I hope that you remember that you are loved. You have so much more to give. Reach into your heart and find a way to survive and thrive again."

## submnu-Environment-and-Habits-77.html

# Environment &amp; Habits | Treating CFS & FM

|
Most people with CFS/FM can improve their sleep by changing their sleep habits and their sleep environment by matching a solution to a problem. Common problems include:
- Irregular hours for going to bed or getting up / no schedule
- Noisy environment (including snoring by sleep partner)
- Lack of control over light and temperature
- Uncomfortable bed
- Tension and worry
- Not allowing time to wind down
- Eating or drinking caffeinated products too close to bedtime
**Strategies**
**Have a Comfortable Environment**
Provide yourself with an environment conducive to good sleep by using a good mattress, and by exercising control over light, noise and temperature. Note: Noise includes snoring by your sleep partner. If that's your situation, it may be necessary to use separate bedrooms.
**Establish a Routine **
Go through the same routine each night and have a consistent bedtime. Prepare for sleep by gradually reducing your activity level in the several hours before bedtime, which may include limiting hours of TV and computer use, and by having a regular routine you go through consistently at the same time each night. Use your bed only for sleep and sex.
**Use Relaxation and Distraction **
If you find it difficult to fall asleep, consider listening to quiet music or distracting yourself in some other way. If you are still unable to sleep, get up and engage yourself with quiet activities such as reading or listening to soft music or relaxation tapes until you are sleepy.
Watching TV, using the computer and playing electronic games all tend to make people more alert, rather than sleepy, so should be avoided if falling back asleep is your goal.
**Control Stress and Worry **
Stress often leads to muscle tension, which makes falling asleep more difficult. Practicing relaxation methods can help. Also, if you are preoccupied with problems, consider setting aside time before going to bed to write down all your worries and what you'll do about them.
Other ways to deal with anxiety include not looking at the clock and not worrying about insomnia. To combat worry, reassure yourself, for example by repeating Dr. Lapp’s saying that quiet rest is almost as good as sleep.
**Get Up at the Same Time **
If you are going to bed later and later, setting an alarm so that you get up at the same time each day can help you adjust gradually back to more normal hours.
** **
**Use Pacing **
Being too active during the day or early evening can create a sense of restlessness called feeling “tired but wired.” Keeping activity within limits and having a winding down period before going to bed are antidotes.
**Limit Daytime Napping **
If you find that napping during the day makes it more difficult to fall asleep at night or your sleep is worse than usual when you take naps, consider sleeping only at night. On the other hand, if napping does not disturb your nighttime sleep, that may be a sign that you need more sleep.
**Avoid Caffeine, Alcohol & Tobacco **
Consuming too much caffeine, drinking alcohol and smoking can each make getting good rest more difficult.
**Check for Medication Side Effects**
Many drugs affect sleep or create sleep-related problems. For example, drugs can produce a feeling of grogginess in the morning. Also, some medications contain substances such as caffeine that interfere with sleep.

## submnu-Exercise-81.html

# Exercise | Treating CFS & FM

Exercise is one of the most-commonly prescribed treatments for FM and can be helpful for CFS as well. An exercise program done regularly can help reduce stiffness, counteract deconditioning and improve outlook. But if not done in a way that respects limits, it can be the cause of relapses so it's best to proceed carefully and check with your doctor.


Here are four guidelines for exercise plus thoughts on the related topic of posture and movement.


**1) Individualize Your Program**



Your exercise program should be tailored to your unique situation. The type, duration and intensity of exercise will depend on the severity of your illness. Also, your exercise program should take into account your better and worse times of day.


Exercise programs for CFS often focus on flexibility and strength training. Pacing should be aplied, so that a period of activity is alternated with rest. For people with severe CFS, the time of exertion might be only a minute, followed by up to several minutes of rest.


An exercise program for fibro can begin with stretching and normally includes both an endurance component such as walking or pool exercise, and strength training two or three times a week.


**2) Set Realistic Goals**



Exercise has a different purpose for CFS and FM patients than for healthy people. Healthy people can set high goals and push themselves. That approach is likely to make symptoms worse for people with CFS and fibromyalgia.

An appropriate exercise goal for CFS would be to improve fitness enough to make daily activities easier. For fibromyalgia, it is the same plus using exercise to reduce stiffness and pain. For an example of exercising safely with CFS, see

Using Targets to Improve Health and Gain Control (see: Using Targets to Improve Health and Gain Control) in the Success Stories section of this site.


**3) Start Low and Go Slow**


Begin by finding a safe level of exercise, one that is matched to your current level of functioning and which does not intensify your symptoms either afterwards or the next day (effects can be delayed).


Dr. Lapp starts his patients with range of motion exercises (stretching). If that is tolerated, he moves on in turn to light resistance exercise (eight ounce weights or stretchy rubber bands such as Therabands); light aerobic activities such as walking in place, walking short distances at a comfortable pace, riding a stationary bike or water walking in a pool; and finally full aerobic activities such as brisk walking, biking or swimming.


Periods of activity should be alternated with rest, so that several minutes of exertion is followed by an equal or greater amount of time resting. For example, walk for five minutes, then sit for five minutes. The length of activity and rest periods will vary from person to person, but might be as little as one to three minutes.


The goal of the exercise program is to have a sustainable level of effort that you can do several times a week, typically every other day, without worsening your symptoms. If your program triggers a flare, reduce it by 50% or return to a level that you can tolerate.


**4) Use Logging and/or Devices to Monitor Your Activity**


Remembering that your goal is to have a level of activity that does not intensify your symptoms, you can evaluate your activity by keeping records and by using a pedometer (step counter) and/or a heart rate monitor.


An exercise log can enable you to associate activity and symptoms. Note the time and duration of exercise, its intensity and your symptom level before, during, after and the next day. You can note symptoms using a ten point scale or letters like L, M and H (low, medium and high). For more on record keeping, see the

[logging](http://www.treatcfsfm.org/content-Logging.html) page.


You can use a pedometer to measure your overall activity level. Dr. Lapp believes that between 1,000 and 5,000 steps a day is a good range for many people with CFS and fibromyalgia. If someone has fewer than 500 steps a day, Dr. Lapp usually suggests they gradually increase the number of steps they take.


If someone is over 5,000 steps a day, Dr. Lapp finds they are usually too active and he advises them to cut back. Dr. Lapp's guidelines imply that 10,000 steps a day, an exercise target often suggested for healthy people, will be inappropriate for most people with CFS and FM. For more on using step counters, see the article

[Pedometers: A Tool for Pacing](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/pedometers-tool-pacing).


Another device, a heart rate monitor, can help you avoid the intensification of symptoms that results from a too-high heart rate. Because activity beyond a threshold triggers flares, keeping the heart rate below that threshold prevents flares.

Some people can exceed their threshold with everyday activities such as climbing a flight of stairs or lifting a child. For how to determine your threshold and strategies for staying within it, see the article

[Pacing By Numbers: Using Your Heart Rate to Stay Inside the Energy Envelope](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/pacing-numbers-using-your-heart-rate-to-stay-inside-energy-envelope).


**Posture & Movement**

People with fibromyalgia can help reduce their pain by experimenting with how they hold their body and how they move. Many find that staying in one position for an extended period of time, sometimes as little as 20 to 30 minutes, increases stiffness and intensifies pain. Moving periodically can help, as can limiting the length of time spent doing repetitive motions like chopping vegetables. Some people are helped by Tai Chi.

Being attentive to posture can help as well. Since people with FM tend to slouch, which puts tension on muscles in the neck and shoulders, Dr Lapp teaches his patients to sit up straight, holding the shoulders back and tucking in the chin.

## submnu-Frustration-and-Anger-96.html

# Frustration &amp; Anger | Treating CFS & FM

|
Frustration and anger are understandable reactions to chronic illness. Being sick is frustrating, since it brings uncertainty and loss of control.
The frustrations of illness vary from not being able to plan daily activities to the loss of the future you had dreamed of. Further, irritability seems to be a symptom of CFS and fibromyalgia.
Self-management can make frustration manageable. The strategies described in other sections, such as pacing and stress management, help reduce the sources of frustration.
For example, by using pacing you can stabilize your life, reducing the swings between high symptoms and periods of remission, and reducing the occurrence of irritability.
Stress reduction practices can help you relax, reducing your susceptibility to frustration. In both instances, techniques used for another purpose can reduce frustration as well.
One way to respond positively is to create a situation focused on finding solutions to what is bothering you. If you are frustrated about a relationship, set up a conversation to discuss your problems.
Pick a time to talk when you and the other person will be calm and not distracted. Before the conversation, ask yourself what the other person could do to improve the situation.
Then, when you meet, explain what is frustrating you. You may be able to defuse anger on the other side by stating that you realize that your illness is frustrating for everyone involved.
Here are five other strategies used by people in our program to deal with frustrations created by being ill. They focus on the goal of finding non-harmful ways to acknowledge and express anger.
**Get Support**
Expressing anger by talking it out with someone who is not the target of your frustration can release the feeling. As one person in the self-help program said, "The frustration and rage I felt about becoming ill has eased considerably since I joined a supportive group. I feel lucky to find a place to vent, be accepted and feel understood."
**Write**
Putting experience in words can be helpful. Psychologist James Pennebaker has found that people have fewer health problems if they write about traumatic events in a way that combines factual description and emotional reactions. (See his book *Opening Up* and also the article [Writing is Good Medicine](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/writing-is-good-medicine).)
Giving verbal form to emotionally powerful experiences brings understanding. A related technique is to write a letter to the person you are mad at, and then tear it up instead of sending it.
**See Things from a Fresh Perspective**
Another way to reduce frustration was shown by a person in our program who trained herself to see situations in new and more positive ways.
"I've learned to think about things in alternative ways. By taming my thoughts, I find that a lot of anger has disappeared and this is a most wonderful feeling. I have now reached the stage where most of this new thinking is automatic."
**Plan Your Response **
If you are irritated by comments like "I'm sure you would feel better if you would try this new remedy," you can prepare a response so that such comments don't bother you.
In this case, you might say something like "Thanks for your suggestion, but I'm under my doctor's care and I'm following his treatment plan" or "I'll keep that in mind."
**Get Professional Help**
Sometimes talking with a counselor can ease the pressures created by having a long-term illness. If frustration and anger are making your relationships more stressful, you might consider getting professional help. Look for a therapist who specializes in helping people with chronic illness.

## submnu-Guilt-97.html

# Guilt | Treating CFS & FM

|
Guilt is another frequent companion of people with CFS and FM. We feel guilty about things we've done and about things we failed to do. For example, we may blame themselves for becoming sick. At other times, we may feel guilty about not contributing to the family or to society.
**True Guilt and False Guilt**
If you experience guilt associated with CFS and FM, what can you do to ease the burden? One potentially helpful approach for reducing this source of mental suffering is to distinguish between *true* guilt and *false* guilt, and to use separate strategies for each..
True guilt is guilt that arises from the recognition that we have harmed others. One appropriate response to true guilt is to apologize and make amends.
Another is to use guilt as a motivation for change. For example, some people in our program say that they have used guilt over canceling out on commitments as an impetus to be more consistent in pacing in order to make themselves more dependable.
In sum, true guilt can be helpful is it motivates you to treat those around you with more consideration and to take better care of yourself in the future.
False guilt, on the other hand, is guilt triggered by things over which you lack control. This type of mental suffering is a negative feeling triggered by not living up to standards that are no longer realistic or because of things out of your control. Here are six ways to respond to false guilt.
**Adjust Your Expectations**
Guilt is often triggered by a difference between a person's expectations and their capabilities. For example, some people with CFS and FM may feel guilty because they are not the parent they hoped to be or are not contributing to the family as they did before they became ill. You can reduce guilt by adjusting your expectations to match your new level of functioning.
Such guilt can be reduced by adjusting expectations to match you new level of functioning. As one person said, "I've lowered my standards for myself. This isn't easy, since I'm a recovering perfectionist."
When self-condemnation is harsh, some people find it helpful to imagine how they would react if they observed another person saying the same things about themselves. A person in our program said that she tells herself, "If I were caring for an injured loved one, in distress, how would I take care of her? I should treat myself the same way."
**Reframe (Change Your Self-Talk)**
Part of the process of adjustment is changing our internal dialogue or self-talk, so that it supports our efforts to live well with illness rather than generating guilt.
One person describes how she has changed her self-talk about naps. In the past, when she took a nap, she told herself it was because she was lazy, but now she tells herself, "I am helping myself to be healthy. I am saving energy to spend time with my husband or to babysit my grandchildren."
Similarly, when feeling tired, you can say "This fatigue is not my fault; it came with CFS. So I don't need to feel guilty about not being able to do everything I used to." Or: "I didn't ask for FM, so why should I feel shame when it prevents me from doing things."
For instructions on how to recognize and change self-talk to be more realistic and more positive, see the article [Changing Self-Talk](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/changing-self-talk).
**When Feeling Guilty, Shift Your Attention**
Even if feeling guilty is inevitable, we can control how we respond when feelings of guilt arise. One person said that she asks herself "Is this feeling productive?"
In some cases, the answer will be "Yes." Guilt can draw our attention to ways in which we have failed to live up to our standards and can motivate us to act differently.
If the feeling is not productive, however, it may be better to respond to guilt by turning our attention elsewhere. As another person wrote, "It's better not to go some places in your head, so I've learned how to control my own thoughts."
Another said that when she is caught up in feeling guilt, she tells herself "this isn't my fault" or "these feelings will pass as long as I don't allow myself to act on them."
**Educate Others (Within Limits)**
Some guilt may be triggered by how others treat you. In addition to adjusting your expectations for yourself, you can work on changing the expectations others have of you as well.
This involves educating the people in your life, emphasizing that CFS and FM are chronic conditions that impose significant limits and require adjustments of the person who is ill and those around her. For ideas on how to do this, see the "Educate Others" section on the Relationship Strategies (see: Relationship Strategies) page.
**Learn Assertiveness**
Another strategy for reducing guilt is to be assertive, standing up for yourself by stating what you will and won't do.
For example, you can teach your family and friends to respect your need for regular rest breaks and can make your limits clear by telling others how long you'll talk on the phone, how much time you will spend at a party and so on.
One person in our program, wanting to strengthen her resolve to set limits with others, posts notes all over her house saying, "I'd love to but I just can't." The notes remind her what to say when people make requests. She says "seeing the notes so often ensures I remember to use this answer without feelings of guilt."
**Practice Relationship Triage**
A final strategy is to reevaluate your relationships, practicing what we call *relationship triage*: making explicit decisions about whom to include in your life, concentrating on the more valuable or necessary relationships and letting others go.
You may decide that some people will never understand your condition or accept that you are ill. In some cases, you might choose to end a relationship. For relationships you decide are necessary, you might limit the frequency or length of contact.

# How Families Can Help | Treating CFS & FM

|
If you are a family member or friend of someone with CFS or FM, thank you for coming to this page.
We recognize that CFS and FM may have had major effects on your life. You may well have more to do now than before and your dreams for the future may have changed. So thank you, again, for considering ways you can help your loved one.
**Ways to Help **
Some help you might give is practical, such as taking on tasks the person with CFS or FM is no longer able to do or providing transportation to doctor appointments. Some help is emotional, offering a listening ear or some reassurance. But perhaps the biggest aid, and the one we focus on here, is supporting the person with CFS or FM in her efforts to live well with long-term illness.
The key fact about CFS and FM is that the severity of symptoms and sometimes even the course of the illness are affected by how a person lives his or her life. The effects are so great that lifestyle change is the treatment of choice for the two conditions.
As Dr. Lapp says, CFS and FM "are best managed with adaptation and lifestyle changes....There is no drug, no potion, no supplement, herb or diet that even competes with lifestyle change for the treatment of CFS or FM."
As a family member or friend of someone with CFS or FM, the way you interact with your loved one will have a significant effect on her, helping her gain control over her condition or making that goal more difficult. The discussion below describes the most important ways you can help.
The help you offer is likely to bring benefits to you as well as to your loved one. For example, if you help your loved one to pace herself, she is likely to have a much more predictable life, reducing uncertainty for herself and those around her.
She is also much more likely to be able to expand her activity level and therefore able to do more without making her symptoms worse. And if you help her get better sleep, she is likely to be less irritable and able to think more clearly.
**Pacing Activity**
Probably the single most important lifestyle change for controlling symptoms and increasing the likelihood of improvement is pacing, which means adjusting activity level to fit the limits imposed by illness.
In contrast to fighting the body with repeated cycles of push and crash, the person who adapts to limits seeks to understand the body's new requirements and to live within them.
With pacing, people with CFS and FM can live their llife according to a plan, rather than in response to symptoms, giving them a sense of managing their illness rather than the illness begin in control.
Learning pacing is a gradual process, usually aken a period of several years and involving the use of multiple strategies as described in the Pacing (see: Pacing) section of this site.
**Managing Stress**
Stress is a challenge for everyone, but it is especially difficult for people with CFS and FM. The two conditions add new stressors and also make people more vulnerable to stress.
CFS and FM reset the physical basis of people's "stress thermostat," so that the effects of a given level of stress are greater than they would be for a healthy person, making managing stress crucial to living well with CFS and FM.
One of the best stress management strategies is preventive: avoidance of stressful situations. This can include avoiding foods and other substances which trigger allergic reactions, and also avoiding or minimizing exposure to bright light, noise and crowds.
Many people with CFS and fibro are selective about their exposure to television and movies, avoiding material that is emotionally arousing and shows with rapid scene or sound changes.
Family and friends can help the person’s stress by learning what factors create stress for their loved one and working together to find ways to reduce or avoid them.
Help may include supporting the loved one in taking rests and leading a structured life, adjusting diet to avoid allergic reactions, and limiting exposure to over-stimulating environments by visiting restaurants when they are not busy or watching a movie at home rather than going to a movie theater.
**In Conclusion**
How people with CFS and fibromyalgia live their lives has a big effect on their symptoms levels and quality of life. Family and friends can help by supporting their loved one’s efforts to adapt to the their condition.
Note: For ideas about how you can help in areas beyond pacing and stress, see the article [How Families Can Help People with CFS or FM](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/how-families-can-help-people-with-cfs-or-fm-0) on the self-help program website.

## submnu-Improving-Intimacy-101.html

# Improving Intimacy | Treating CFS & FM

|
When CFS or fibromyalgia enters a marriage, one casualty can be intimacy between the partners. Pain, reduced energy, reduced interest, health problems of the partner, and increased responsibilities for the healthy spouse can all affect a couple's sex life, but like other aspects of long-term illness, intimacy issues an be addressed sucessfully.
When we asked people in the self-help program to describe the effects of their illness on their sexuality, all those who responded said that illness had reduced their sexual activity.
Many people mentioned having a much lower level of sexual desire than before, due to factors like ongoing fatigue and pain, and the side effects of medications. Other causes of sexual problems included the effects of menopause, relationship strains, and the medical problems and/or impotence of their partner.
Even though people said that they had either reduced their sexual expression or given up sex, most also reported using a variety of strategies that have either enabled them to adapt their intimacy to their illness or to connect with their partner in other ways. Here are six of the most common adaptations.
** **
**Open Discussion**
Several people reported that their relationship with their partner improved after they talked openly about their reduced interest in sex.
One woman said, "I explained that I still loved him and felt the same (or more strongly) about him, but I just couldn't show that through initiating sex...I have no desire for self-pleasure either. Explaining that sure made a difference to his acceptance of my state!"
Others reported that they benefited from open communication in bed. One said, "I let him know if a certain position hurts and we change positions."
**Alternative Activities, In Bed and Out**
Another very common theme was adapting to illness by focusing on alternatives to conventional sex. One person wrote, "The times I am not up to having intercourse, he knows I am usually up for some cuddling and happy to satisfy him another way."
Another reported, "What helped my husband the most was understanding that the lack of sex was nothing that was his fault, but just a mmanifestation of my illness.
Others wrote of alternatives to intercourse, for those who think that appropriate. "You don't have to have intercourse to be sexually connected...You can be satisfied by manual stimulation and also oral sex."
Others have found other ways to express their affection: through hugging, kissing, and holding hands, through words of appreciation and thoughtful acts, and through shared activities like going out for dinner together, watching a favorite TV program or giving one another a massage. One said, "We still hug, kiss and say ‘I love you' lots. I feel we have a very strong and healthy relationship."
** **
**Planning**
Another common adaptation is planning for sex. Several people mentioned taking extra rest or reducing their activity level on days they anticipated having sex.
Also, a number said they and their partners plan "dates." One said, "The ‘date’ planning has worked for me because I tend to do less of the things that I know will cause me residual pain."
Others mentioned being mindful of time of day. Pain and other symptoms may be lower during certain hours of the day. By timing intimacy for those times, couples minimize discomfort and increase enjoyment.
Another couple is increasing the frequency of sex through making a commitment to have sex once a week. The wife reporterd that sex is becoming less painful and her husband "is much more cheerful and doing more around the house."
**Flexibility and Experimentation**
Given the often unpredictable course of CFS and FM, it helps to be flexible about when sex occurs and what positions and activities are involved. One person said, "We've experimented with timing (morning is best), position (I seem to do best on my side) and lubricants."
Others use observation as a basis for experimentation. One person wrote, "I noticed that in the summer I had more desire and realized it had to do with the heat, so we started to shower together."
**Addressing Pain and Hormone Problems**
Some people said that their sex lives improved after treatment of pain and hormone problems. They reported treating pain by the use of pain pills, topical ointments, massage and heat, and by adapting how intimacy occurs.
There are several factors involved in the use of medication. One solution is for the person who is ill to time the taking of pain medication so that it will be at peak effectiveness when sex is planned to occur.
The type of pain medication is also important. The person with pain may want to avoid narcotic pain medications and tranquilizers, which dull the senses as well as reducing pain.
Other means of pain reduction include taking a bath before sex, stretching and massage. Pain can be reduced by using positions that are comfortable, by changing positions periodically during intimacy, and by alternating activity and rest.
Another pain control approach is the combination of distraction and meditation. Distraction means reducing pain by placing attention elsewhere, focusing on sensations, both those given and those received. Also, concentrating on mental images of making love keeps the mind focused on pleasure, distracting attention from pain.
Several people commented on how their interest in sex had improved with hormone treatment, either estrogen, testosterone or both. One said that testing showed that both her estrogen and testosterone levels were low. Treatment of the latter "not only helped libido, but my energy level as well." Hormone problems can also affect men.
**Emphasis on Caring**
A number of people distinguished between intimacy and sex, and said they and their partners focused on closeness and mutual caring. One wrote, "Sex is important in a relationship, but I don't feel that it is the most important. I think all of the little everyday things that we do for each other and being supportive of each other is what really makes a marriage."
Another said, "My husband and I have found we don't NEED to expres our affection sexually...For us, sex does not compare to the kind of fulfillment which is a beaituful thing when shared between two people who are filled with warm, tender, loving feelings toward each other." She wrote of expressing affection through shring time together, touching, caressing, and cuddling.
**In Conclusion**
CFS or fibromyalgia do not have to mean the end of sex. Using flexibility, experimentation, and good communication, couples can continue to enjoy sex and may be able to strengthen their relationships. For those who decide that sex will no longer be a part of their relationsip, a focus on other aspects of the relationsdhips can foster closeness and caring.

## submnu-Limiting-Severity-107.html

# Limiting Severity | Treating CFS & FM

|
There are many things you can do to limit the length and severity of relapses. Some are actions to take; others are mental adjustments to make the situation more understandable or bring consolation.
**Get Losts of Rest**
The most common strategy for overcoming setbacks is to take extra rest, continuing until the flare subsides (and even beyond --see next point). Dr. Lapp recommends alternating small amounts of activity and rest in a quiet, non-distracting place such as a sofa or lounger. (He discourages patients from staying in bed.) He also advises stretching and relaxation techniques.
**Return to Normal Slowlly**
Long periods of rest can create frustration, which may lead to resuming a normal activity level before the body is ready, leading, in turn, to another relapse. To avoid a double-dip relapse, return gradually to a normal activity level.
For many people, this means taking more rest than usual for two or three days after a relapse *seems* to be over.
**Postpone, Delegate or Eliminate Tasks**
Reducing activity by postponing tasks, asking for help or deciding not to do something can help speed the end of a setback.
**Use Positive Self-Talk**
It's easy to get discouraged during a relapse and to say things that increase discouragement, such as "I'll never get over this" or "What if I'm stuck permanently at this level?"
Being able to speak positively and truthfully to yourself is a way to reduce stress and make it more likely you'll do things that will help. To do so, you can say soothing words to yourself that make it more likely you'll stick with things that help. You might say things such as “I've bounced back from all my other relapses, so chances are good I'll bounce back this time, too."
**Stay Connected**
It's easy to feel isolated during a relapse. You can counteract that by staying in touch with people.via phone calls, emails, and sometimes in-person meetings. Jusl feeling connected with another person can be reassuring. By talking to others, you can distract yourself from your problems. Also, you may hear some ideas about how to deal with the relapse.
**Postpone, Delegate or Eliminate**
Reducing activity by postponing tasks, asking for help or even letting go of something as unnecessary can help speed the end of a setback.
**Write a Letter to Yourself to Read in a Flare**
Knowing that relapses can lead to depression, several people in the self-help program have planned ahead and written a reassuring letter to themselves, which they can read to buoy their spirits while in a relapse.
**Prepare**
Having things handy and in place can help reduce the anxiety of a crash and make it easier to weather. You might keep a large supply of food in the house, including food that your family can cook (or defrost and heat).
**Learn to Identify and Respond to Warning Signs**
You may be able to reduce the length of a setback, or even prevent it, by training yourself to spot relapse warning signs and to take quick action.
Warning signs that a relapse is imminent may include:
- Feeling especially weak, dizzy, tired or confused
- Having more intense symptoms than usual
- Feeling more confused than usual
- Feeling cranky
Responses may include lying down, reducing your activity level, limiting sensory input and/or limiting your time with other people.
**Address Perpetuating Factors**
If a setback goes on longer than usual, Dr. Lapp suggests you look for perpetuating factors and address any you find.
- Sleep often deteriorates during a relapse, so attempts should be made to insure a good sleep. Eight to nine hours of sleep nightly are generally recommended, but it may be necessary to sleep longer during relapses.
- Anxiety and depression often flare up during a relapse. If untreated they may perpetuate the relapse by interfering with sleep, motivation, pain tolerance, and energy. If positive self-talk is not effective, it may be helpful to increase an antidepressant dose temporarily.
- Relapses can be caused or lengthened by other medical problems. Infections such as recurrent bronchitis, cystitis, infected teeth or absesses can both trigger and perpetuate relapses. Hidden infections such as a dental absess canperpetuate symptoms. In endemic areas persisting infections such as Lyme Disease can be the cause.
- A good medical examination and some laboratory studies can identify infections as well as medical problems such as thyroid abnormalities and hypoadrenalism.
- Allergies, either seasonal (hay fever) or situational (new pet in the house), may be an aggravating factor, and hormonal changes such as menopause have far reaching effects on sleep, joint discomfort, and neuroendocrine imbalances.
- Finally, medications can contribute to relapses. Failure to take prescribed medications can worsen symptoms. Also, drug interactions may create problems. If you suspect medications could be a cause of symptoms, review them with your doctor and eliminate everything that is non-essential.

## submnu-Managing-Triggers-108.html

# Managing Triggers | Treating CFS & FM

|
Some relapses may be due to the waxing and waning of your illness, but other setbacks are triggered by actions you take and situations you can learn to manage or avoid. You can begin to gain control over relapses by identifying the causes that apply to you.
To get you started, here are seven triggers often mentioned by people in the self-help program. The first four are the causes mentioning most frequently. (Some people remember the top three using the acronym SOS: Sleep problems, Overactivity, and Stress.)
**Overactivity**
Living outside one’s limits is the the most common cause of intensified symptoms. The antidote: pacing. Keeping to a daily routine in which you live consistently within your limits reduces the frequency and severity of relapses.
**Poor Sleep**
Non-restorative sleep, the second mostly frequently mentioned relapse trigger, can intensify symptoms and precipitate a vicious cycle in which symptoms and poor sleep reinforce one another. The solution: address sleep problems by improving sleep habits, using medications and treating sleep disorders. (For details, see the page on Sleep (see: Sleep).)
**Stress**
CFS and fibromyalgia make people very stress-sensitive, so minimizing stress can prevent relapses. Stressors may include ongoing symptoms; isolation; emotionally-charged events, such as financial problems, a disability review or a move; physical illness; or long-term situations, such as family conflict. (For ideas on reducing stress, see the Managing Stress (see: Managing Stress) section of the site.)
**Sensory Overload**** **
If you are sensitive to light, noise or crowds, you may experience intensified symptoms in situations of sensory overload. One common solution is avoidance. For example, get together with one or a few people rather than a large group. Visit stores and restaurants when they are not busy. Wear sunglasses and ear plugs in places that use fluorescent light or are noisy. For more, see the article [Sensory Overload: Sources and Strategies](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/sensory-overload-sources-and-strategies) on the self-help program website.
**Travel and Other Special Events**
Special events, like a vacation, family visits or the holidays, can trigger a relapse. The solution: reduced activity level and planning ahead using the strategies outlined on the Travel & Special Events (see: Travel &amp; Other Special Events) page.
**Other Illnesses**
Coming down with an acute illness, such as a cold or flu, or having multiple chronic illnesses can reduce energy and worsen CFS and FM symptoms. By treating other conditions and acknowledging that they intensify symptoms, you can reduce CFS and FM flares.
**Stressful Relationships (Particular People)**
Interactions with people who are negative, demanding or hyperactive may be a source of stress. Responses include talking with the person to redefine the relationship, limiting contact, getting professional help and ending the relation.

## submnu-Medications-for-Pain-83.html

# Medications for Pain | Treating CFS & FM

**General Notes on Drugs for FM & CFS**
Drug therapy for pain in FM and CFS is to be avoided if possible, because of side effects and the possibility of addiction. If you decide to use the FDA-approved medications (Lyrica, Cymbalta, or Savella) and other medications for pain, it is important to have realistic expectatons. They don’t eliminate pain, but they may reduce it for a period of time in some patients.
Because no medication is consistently helpful for people with FM and CFS, and because pain relievers sometimes lose effectiveness over time, experimentation is usually required. Also, patients are started on dosages that are a small fraction of normal dosage levels.
Many fibromyalgia patients also experience Myofascial Pain Syndrome (MPS), a pain condition localized in *trigger* points (specific locations in muscles or fascia, not to be confused with *tender* points used to diagnose FM). MPS may be treated with medication, physical therapies such as massage and myofascial release, and the injection of local anesthetics into the trigger points.
Some people with CFS and FM experience neuropathic or nerve pain, burning or electric shock sensations felt most commonly in the hands and feet. This type of pain is often treated with anti-seizure medications, such as Neurontin (gabapentin) or Lyrica (pregabalin).
**Specific Recommendations**
**Analgesics**
People with FM and CFS who who seek pain relief through medications usually begin with non-prescription products, such as aspirin and other over-the-counter pain relievers such as Advil (ibuprofen), Aleve (naproxen) and Tylenol (acetaminophen). Prescription drugs that improve sleep or relax muscle tension can have a beneficial effect on pain as well.
**Antidepressants**
A second category is antidepressants, of two kinds. Low doses of tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine, nortriptyline) can be helpful, but these medications are frequently associated with significant side effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision, and weight gain, and they tend to work less well over time.
More recently, NSRIs (Norepinephrine-Serotonin reuptake Inhibitors) have been shown to be effective for pain, have fewer side effects, tend to be weight neutral, and are durable. That is, they remain effective after months of use. These include Effexor (venlefaxine), Cymbalta (duloxetine), and Savella (milnacipran). Cymbalta and Savella have been FDA approved for treating pain from fibromyalgia.
**Anti-Epileptics**
Third, epilepsy drugs have long been known to reduce atypical or neuropathic pain, and have been useful in both CFS and FM. The first drug of this type was Neurontin (gabapentin). More recently Lyrica (pregabalin) has been FDA approved for the treatment of fibropain.
**Tramadol**
Fourth is Tramadol (aka Ultram, Ultracet, Ryzolt, and others). This drug is in a unique class called “opiate / non-opiate.” Tramadol has the strength of codeine but fewer adverse reactions and is rarely addictive. Therefore, it is very effective and safer for people with CFS and fibromyalgia than narcotic medications.
**Low Dose Naltexone**
In the last decade or so, it has been recognized that glial cells in the brain can affect neurons. When activated or "angry," these glial cells sensitize neurons and magnify pain. Serendipitously, it was found that a low dose of the narcotic antagonist naltexone could calm angry glial cells and reduce fibropain. Thus, the antidote for narcotic overdose has become a pain remedy!
Experience has shown that about 60% of people with fibropain will respond to Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN). Since LDN is a narcotic antagonist, one cannot take narcotics such as codeine, hydrocodone or oxycodone at the same time as LDN. Also, you have to wean off all narcotics for several days before starting LDN or risk withdrawal symptoms.
This is an off-label investigational use of naltexone, so LDN is neither covered by most insurers, nor is it available at most chain drug stores. Fortunately, it is inexpensively and easily obtained at most compounding pharmacies. The usual dose is 5mg daily, in the morning. Side effects are unusual, although some individuals experience nausea or insomnia at first. Side effects can be minimized by starting with 1mg daily and increasing the dose slowly.
**Narcotics**
Finally, there are narcotics. Narcotics are not recommended except via a referral to a pain management specialist.

## submnu-Medications-for-Sleep-78.html

# Medications for Sleep | Treating CFS & FM

|
Treating sleep with drugs is challenging because there is no single medication that has proven helpful in solving sleep problems for people with CFS and fibromyalgia. Also, many patients develop drug tolerance, so that a medication becomes less effective over time. For both these reasons, sleep problems can benefit from a flexible, experimental approach that utilizes a variety of strategies.
If you think medications might improve your sleep, first consider over the counter (non-prescription) products like melatonin, valerian and tryptophan, simple antihistamines such as Benadryl, Tylenol PM and Advil PM, or doxylamine (used in Nyquil). These also help when used with other sleep treatments. Other non-prescription sleep aids include passion flower and chamomile. Amino acids, such as L-theanine and L-tryptophan are sometimes helpful when other treatments fail.)
If none of these work, you can try prescription medications. A reasonable approach in this case is to find a physician willing to work with you to find what helps in your unique situation. Since people with CFS and FM are extremely sensitive to medications, your doctor should start with low doses and increase slowly to find a dose that is both effective and tolerated.
In patients who have trouble both falling asleep and staying asleep, a particularly useful combination is Klonopin (clonazepam) with a dosage of 0.5-1mg to initiate sleep together with trazodone 25-50mg or a tricyclic antidepressant to help maintain sleep. Examples of the latter include doxepin (10-25mg), amitriptyline (10-25mg) or nortripyline (10-25mg). Amitriptyline has been most widely and successfully used, but doxepin is available in a liquid form, so doses as low as one drop (equals 0.5mg) can be used.
Next step would be a non-hypnotic medication such as Lunesta (eszopiclone), Rozerem (ramelteon), or Sonata (zaleplon). These work to naturally stimulate the sleep center of the brain, and are not thought to be addicting. Sonata has the benefit of being short acting (3-4 hours, so it can be taken for early awakening). Lunesta has been approved for long term use. Belsomra (suvorexant) is the newest sleep medication. It works uniquely by suppressing orexin, a neurotransmitter that promotes wakefulness. Belsomra has been alleged to help patients not only fall asleep but stay asleep.
The hyponotic drug Ambien® (zolpidem) is useful for both sleep initiation and maintenance. Zolpidem increases the depth of sleep but users may adapt to the drug over time, and some people experience amnesia and/or sleep walking.
Analgesics and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used for pain and often benefit sleep as well.
Xyrem (sodium oxybate) has some appealing properties, because it increases slow wave sleep and restores rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. The medication has been approved by the FDA as a treatment for narcolepsy and, although studies have shown its effectiveness in fibromyalgia, the FDA has concluded that the risks outweigh the benefits in treating FM.
While medications can improve sleep, they can also make it worse. Some drugs disrupt sleep by reducing slow wave sleep or causing restless legs and periodic legs movements. These include benzodiazepines (except low-dose Klonopin), narcotics, and antidepressants such as Prozac and Wellbutrin. Also, some drugs produce side effects, like a feeling of grogginess in the morning. Medications that contain caffeine and some antihistamines may interfere with sleep.
High doses of opioid pain relievers such as morphine and oxycodone can disrupt sleep. Ultram (tramadol) has the potential to interfere with sleep (even at low doses) because of its antidepressant-like action. If you are on one of these opioids, you may consider taking a minimal amount at bedtime or earlier in the evening. Heat, topical analgesics, tizanidine / Zanaflex, and Lyrica may both treat pain and aid with sleep.

## submnu-Mental-Adjustments-104.html

# Mental Adjustments | Treating CFS & FM

|
Pacing means changing behaviors, but it also involves changing how you think: acknowledging the need to lead a different kind of life and adjusting your expectations to match your new limits.
Mental adjustments that aid consistency include the following:
**Adjust Your Expectations**
As mentioned earlier, many strategies for succeeding at pacing require the development of new habits and routines. These, in turn, are based on adjusted expectations, ones consistent with your limits.
The ability to develop new expectations is based on adpting a different attitude, a particular kind of acceptance. As explained by CFS patient Dean Anderson in a success story (see: Acceptance, Discipline & Hope: A Story of Recovery from CFIDS) on this site, this acceptance is not resignation, but rather "an acceptance of the reality of the illness and of the need to lead a different kind of life, perhaps for the rest of my life."
Coming to acceptance is a process that often takes several years, but it has significant benefits. In the words of one person, "I've discovered that I can now be perfectly at peace with lowering my expectations as I know too well what happens when I try to push the envelope and then relapse."
**Listen to Your Body**
One way to reduce the effects of overdoing is by retraining youself to respond differently to the signals sent by your body. Instead of ignoring your body's signals, you can learn to hear and respond to its warning signs.
An example was provided by a person in the self-help program who was cooking chili one day and became very weak and tired. The chili was nearly done and his first thought was "Finish the job; it will take only another 10 minutes."
Then he remembered similar episodes when he ignored the signal and ended up needing to rest for two or three hours. So he turned off the heat under the chili and laid down for 15 minutes. When he got up, he felt fine. Listening to his body enabled him to avoid several hours of rest.
**Stop & Choose**
One way that people get pulled outside their limits is by giving in to the temptation to do something that seems appealing at the moment. A way to avoid such lapses is to stop before you act and realize you have a choice.
One woman in the self-help program carries a card in her purse to remind her of the consequences of overactivity. One side says “What are the consequences of my doing X?" (In other words, what is the cost of doing some activity.) The other side reads "Just say No." (An alternative is to ask: "Am I willing to accept the consequences of X?”)
Another way to stop and choose is to visualize how you will feel if you go outside your limits. Some people, for example, imagine themselves lying in bed in a dark room, tired and in pain, with severe brain fog. Another strategy is to remind yourself of your choice by saying things like “I can finish this task and crash or listen to my body and stop.”
Alternatively, you can focus on the positive and give yourself reminders of what you gain through pacing. For example, you might post notes to yourself in prominent places in your house, saying things such as “Staying within my limits gives me a sense of control,” "Pacing reduces my symptoms," or "Pacing makes my life more stable."
**Learn Assertiveness**** **
Some people with CFS and FM have difficulty acting in their own interest. In some cases, the answer is to learn assertiveness, which involves finding your limits and then communicating them to others.
One person in the self-help program reported that she was able to avoid setbacks when she learned to speak up for herself. She said, "Communicating clearly when I need medicine, rest or quiet time and taking time for these things when I need them all help me to prevent relapses."
Other people have a habit of putting others’ needs ahead of their own. As one person in the self-help program said, “Even after becoming seriously ill with CFS, I felt a huge responsibility to take care of my family as I always had.”
Sometimes called “people pleasers,” these individuals have difficulty setting limits or saying “no” to others. Because of this view, people pleasers may not take care of themselves. This trait can be deeply ingrained and may require counseling to change.
**Forgive Yourself**
No one stays within their limits all of the time. Life has its ups and downs; some times are more stressful than others. Instead of beating yourself up when you slip or circumstances overwhelm you, it’s better just to ask two questions:
- What's the best thing I can do right now to help myself?
- What can I learn from this experience?

# Other Fog Busters | Treating CFS & FM

|
Use these additional strategies to control cognitive problems.
**Do Something Physical **
Physical activity can increase energy and clear your mind. Activity includes exercise, laughing, singing and deep breathing. For some people, fog may be triggered by lack of nutrition. For them, eating counteracts mental fuzziness.
**Plan Your Response**** **
Deal with the fact that brain fog is confusing by planning your response ahead of time. For example, you might decide to respond to fog by lying down or by switching to a less demanding task. Over time, you will create a new habit, making your response to fog automatic.
**Control Stress**** **
Stress can trigger or intensify brain fog. You can reduce fog by avoiding stressful situations, by learning how to relax in response to stress and by training yourself to mute the production of adrenaline.
For more, see the discussion of stress (see: Managing Stress) on this site and the articles on [stress management ](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/topic/Stress-Management )on the self-help program website.
** **
**Do a Medication**** Check**** **
Medications are a major cause of fog. If you find that a prescription drug increases your fog, consider talking to your doctor about adjusting the dosage levels or changing to a different medication. Also, discuss with your doctor the use of medications to increase attention and concentration.
The goal with drugs is to use the fewest drugs at the lowest effective doses. Part of drug therapy is to challenge medications from time to time by suspending their use. If you're interested, discuss this with your doctor.
**Reframe Your Thoughts**** **
Brain fog can be frightening and embarrassing, but you can learn to speak reassuringly to yourself and to others when you feel a lack of mental clarity. Also, if you feel anxious just thinking about something you have to do, try slowing down, for example by focusing on your breathing for a minute or so.
For more on reframing, see the discussion of reframing on the page about Guilt (see: Guilt) and the section on reframing in the article How I Created a Good Life with Fibromyalgia (see: How I Created a Good Life with Fibromyalgia).

## submnu-Other-Treatments-for-Pain-84.html

# Other Treatments for Pain | Treating CFS & FM

|
People with CFS and FM also use other approaches to reducing their pain, including the following.
**Treating Fatigue and Poor Sleep**
Pain, fatigue and poor sleep are tightly connected. When we feel tired, we experience pain more intensely, thus reducing fatigue lessens pain. Similarly, poor sleep intensifies pain, so improving sleep can help control pain. Of the three symptoms, poor sleep is often the one addressed first.
**Heat, Cold and Massage**
Heat, cold and massage can be used for temporary relief of pain. Heat is best utilized for reducing the pain that results from muscle tension and inactivity. The warmth increases blood flow and thereby produces some relaxation, reducing pain and easing stiff joints and sore muscles.
For localized pain, heating pads or hot packs are used frequently. For overall relief, people often use warm baths, soaks in a hot tub or lying on an electric mattress pad.
Cold treatments decrease inflammation by reducing blood flow to an area. They also may numb the areas that are sending pain signals. You might use gel packs, ice packs or bags of frozen vegetables. With both heat and cold, you should not use the treatment for more than 15 or 20 minutes at a time.
Massage of painful areas can also provide temporary relief from pain. Like heat, massage increases blood flow and can also relieve spasms. You can consider three different forms of massage: self-massage using your hands, massage using a handheld device, and professional massage. If you use a massage therapist, ask her to be cautious and to check frequently on your pain sensitivity.
**Distraction**
Immersing yourself in pleasant thoughts and activities can lessen pain by providing distraction. Imagery can be especially helpful, as you visualize a pleasant scene, involving as many senses as possible.
If you want to transport yourself to the beach, see the light shimmering on the water, feel the warmth of the sun on your skin, hear the waves crashing and smell the mustard from the hotdogs. (For step-by-step instructions, see the section on imagery in the article [Stress Reduction: Five Practical Techniques](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/stress-reduction-five-practical-techniques).)
Engaging in activities that bring pleasure also provide distraction from pain. Examples include reading a book, watching a movie, having a good conversation, taking a bath, listening to or playing music and spending time in nature.
**Problem Solving**
You can gain some control over pain by identifying the situations that trigger or intensify pain, and then taking steps to change them.
For example, you might find that you are not able to keep up with household chores as you used to. Using problem solving, you brainstorm a variety of solutions, such as spreading chores out over several days, taking rest breaks during chores, and getting help from others. You then try a solution to see whether it works, evaluate, and try again.
**Changing Self-Talk**
Thoughts can have a dramatic effect on mood and, in turn, on the perception of pain. Negative thoughts can start a vicious cycle. An increase in symptoms may trigger negative thoughts like "I'll never get better" or "It's hopeless."
Such thoughts can create anxiery, sadness, anger and a sense of helplessness. These reactions intensify pain and may trigger another round of negative thoughts and more muscle tension.
This cycle can be reversed. It’s possible to learn to recognize and to change habitual thoughts to make them more positive and more realistic. This well-researched approach, called Cognitive Therapy, can be found in books like *Feeling Good* by David Burns and *Learned Optimism* by Martin Seligman.

## submnu-Pacing-for-Fog-85.html

# Pacing for Fog | Treating CFS & FM

|
You can use the following pacing strategies to reduce cognitive problems.
**Take Rest**** Breaks**
Cognitive difficulties can be caused by too much activity, so one response if you’re not thinking clearly is to take a break. A brief rest may be enough to end, or at least reduce, your fog. In this way, fog serves a positive purpose; it helps you recognize when you are outside your limits and need to slow down. Note: overactivity applies to mental activity as well as physical.
Getting the right balance between activity and rest is one of the keys to gaining control in CFS and FM. For more, see the page [Scheduled Rests](http://www.treatcfsfm.org/submnu-Scheduled-Rests-89.html) in the Pacing section of this site.
**Use Routine**
Reduce confusion by living a predictable life with routines: doing the same things every day in the same way at about the same time. For example, always put your keys in your purse when you arrive home. If your fog is thickest in the morning, put out your clothes the night before.
** **
**Pick Your Best Time of Day**
Do the tasks that require concentration and mental clarity during the hours you are sharpest. The best time of day varies from person to person. Experiment to find the time that's best for you. For more, see Additional Pacing Strategies (see: Additional Strategies).
**Postpone, Switch Tasks or Cancel Activities **
If you're not thinking clearly, postpone jobs that are mentally challenging, switch to a simpler task or take a break. As one person in the self-help program says, "When I'm too tired and foggy to think, I put things off until the next day and get extra rest instead."

## submnu-Pacing-for-Pain-80.html

# Pacing for Pain | Treating CFS & FM

|
A frequent cause of pain is overdoing or having an activity level that is beyond a person's limits. Pacing offers a way to bring stability and control by keeping activity level within the limits imposed by illness.
Pacing can involve a variety of strategies, including:
- Reducing overall activity level
- Delegating
- Alternating activity and rest
- Having short activity periods
- Switching between high and low intensity tasks
- Using the best hours of day for the most demanding activities
- Staying within limits for mental and social activity
- Keeping records to see links between activity and symptoms
Pacing is the heart of lifestyle adjustment to CFS and FM, and helps control all of the four main symptoms. For ideas on how to incorporate pacing into your life, see the section on Pacing (see: Pacing).
|

## submnu-Planned-Rests-89.html

# Planned Rests | Treating CFS & FM

|
Having regular daily rest periods is an important part of pacing, and for many people with CFS and FM the heart of their work to adjust to limits. Scheduled rests give you a way to control symptoms, avoid flare-ups and bring greater predictability to your life.
We often refer to planned rest breaks as *pre-emptive rest*, and contrast it to *recuprerative rest.* The latter used to recover from overdoing. In contrast, scheduled or pre-emptive rest is a preventive measure, a strategy for reducing symptoms, gaining stability and reducing total rest time. It's a way to avoid flare-ups and escape the cycle of push and crash.
Scheduled rest is a popular energy management strategy because it is straightforward and brings immediate benefits to most people who use it: greater stability, reduced symptoms and greater stamina. Scheduled resting often results in a reduction in total rest time, because of a reduction in crashes that require long rest periods for recovery.
We use the term *rest* in a special way. For us, it means lying down with your eyes closed in a quiet place. If this way of taking a break doesn't work for you, you might experiment with other ways of resting, such as listening to quiet music or a meditation app. The important thing is to take a break from normal activity and create a quiet place to recharge your batteries.
For people with light to moderate CFS or FM, a scheduled rest plan might mean one or two rests of 15 minutes to half an hour each. Those with severe conditions may benefit from taking many brief rests a day, for example a 10 to 15 minute rest every hour or two.
Planned rest is often the first pacing strategy tried by people in the self-help program. Here are the thoughts of three people who experimented with it while taking the introductory self-help class.
*[Right after starting the class,] I decided to incorporate two scheduled rests into my day and the results have been incredible. My symptoms and pain have decreated and I feel more 'in control'. My sleep has been more refreshing and even my mood has improved.*
Since I've been forcing myself to rest every day, I have found I have more stamina. And I've noticed the graph of my days doesn't dip and rise so steeply.
I have been resting between activities, sometimes only for five minutes. For the first time in the four and a half years that I have been ill, I feel that it is possible to manage my symtoms and have some predictability in my life.
You may be tempted to skip your rests on days when you are feeling good. At such times, it may be helpful to remind yourself that, by taking scheduled rests, you are avoiding symptoms, and more rest, in the future. Resting according to a fixed schedule, not just when you feel sick or tired, is part of a shift from living in response to symptoms to living a more predictable and stable life.
If you want to try scheduled rest, we recommend you start with lying down in a quiet place with your eyes closed. If you find yourself distracted by your thoughts, try using a relaxation technique or listening to music or to a relaxation CD.
If lying down doesn’t work for you, experiment with other ways of resting, for example resting in an easy chair or reading a book. If you fall asleep while resting, it may be a sign that your body requires more rest.

## submnu-Prevention-109.html

# Prevention | Treating CFS & FM

|
The last step in controlling relapses is preventive: using lifestyle habits to avoid relapses. You can reduce and perhaps even eliminate relapses using the strategies described below.
**Pace Yourself **
Pacing is the most powerful strategy for bringing stability to life and preventing setbacks. Pacing means adjusting activity to the limits imposed by illness. Pacing involves a variety of specific strategies, including having short activity periods, shifting among different activities, living according to a schedule, and using individualized rules.
For details, see the Pacing Strategies (see: Pacing Strategies) and Achieving Consistency (see: Achieving Consistency) sections.
**Take Schedled Rests**
[Scheduled rests](http://www.treatcfsfm.org/submnu-Scheduled-Rests-89.html), done on a regular basis, can prevent relapses. Also, taking extra rest before, during and after special events or after a secondary illness can help you avoid setbacks or limit their severity.
**Manage Stress**
CFS and fibro both increase peoples' stress and make them more sensiivite to stress. It's usually helpful to use multiple strategies to manage it.
A typical stress management plan might include a daily relaxation procedure, daily walks, taking regular rest breaks daily, having pleasurable activites every day and living by a schedule. For more,see the Managing Stress (see: Managing Stress) section of the site.
**Take Medications Faithfully & Consider Supplements**
Dr. Lapp reminds his patients to take prescribed medications consistently. He also recommends a limited list of supplements. (For details on the latter, see the [article](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/dr-lapp's-recommedations-supplements) on that topic at the self-help program website.)
**Make Mental Adjustments**
Many of the strategies for limiting relapses require new habits and behaviors, but their foundation lifes in adjusting our expecttions to fit without our limits. For example, one person in the self-help program says, "I've had to retrain myself from saying 'I work 'til done' to 'I stop when tired'.
**Listen to Your Body**
There is a strong temptation to respond to the onset of symptoms by "pushing through." A different approach, listening to and responding to the body's signals, can prevent relapses. As someone in the self-help program said, "I have become aware of the warning signs that my body sends me when I'm doing too much and I am learning to stop as soon as symptoms appear."
**Use Routine**
Living your life in a planned and pedictable way can help reduce relapses because routine is less stressful than novelty and because having a predictable life increases your chances for staing wtihin your limits.
**Use Logging & Record ****Keeping**
Keeping a health log can reduce relapses in three ways. First, records can give you a detailed understaning of your limits, the foundation for avoiding overdoing.
Second, records can help you hold yourself accountable. Seeing evidence of a connection between overactivity and increased symptoms brings home the fact that activity level affects symptoms.
Third, records can serve as a source of motivation. Seeing how living within the energy envelope reduces symptoms reinforces your successes and provides a motivation toward further improvement.
**Be Assertive**** **
Believing it is your right to protect your health and standing up for yourself can help you stay within your limits. As one person in the self-help program said, "Communicating clearly when I need medicine, rest, or quiet time and taking time for these things when I need them [all] help me to prevent a relapse." For an assertiveness success story, see the article [Pacing and Assertiveness](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/pacing-and-assertiveness) on the self-help program website.

# Professional Support | Treating CFS & FM

|
Many people with CFS and fibromyalgia seek help from therapists and counselors. Such professionals can provide support and offer an outsider’s view of your situation.
If you’re interested, you might look for one who specializes in working with people who have chronic illness. Other people with CFS and FM, such as those you might meet in a support group, are often a good source of leads.
Therapy can also be helpful for couples, offering a place in which the strains created by living with long-term illness can be addressed and solutions explored.
Next >> (see: Your New Life) |

## submnu-Relaxation-82.html

# Relaxation | Treating CFS & FM

|
The experience of pain is intensified by stress and by emotions like worry, frustration and depression. Emotions create muscle tension, which is directly painful. Emotions also contribute to the experience of pain indirectly by increasing stress and a sense of helplessness.
Relaxation is an antidote to both tension and stress. Also, it offers a distraction from pain. For some people, relaxation involves the regular use of a formal relaxation or meditation procedure, such the Relaxation Response, the Body Scan, Progressive Muscle Relaxation and the use of imagery. (For step by step instructions, see the article [Stress Reduction: Five Practical Techniques](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/stress-reduction-five-practical-techniques) on the self-help program website.) Other relaxing activities include exercise, mindful breathing, baths and hot tubs, massage, rest breaks and listening to tapes or CDs.
Integrating one or more periods of relaxation into your daily routine counteracts pain, stress and negative emotions.

## submnu-Routine,-Reminders,-Rules-103.html

# Routine, Reminders, Rules | Treating CFS & FM

|
This page is about the three R's of pacing --*routine, reminders *and *rules*-- plus a bonus fourth R: *records*. But first, a general guideline.
**Make Changes Gradually**
You may feel overwhelmed at times when you think of all the adjustments you have to make to reduce symptoms and regain control. The solution: focus on one thing at a time.
One person described how she changed by saying, "The transformation into a more disciplined person was a long-term process. The changes have been introduced gradually over time. And I make sure I find the right one before Imove on to adding the next."
**Routine**
Developing routines is one way to increase consistency. Doing things in a regular and customary way reduces energy expenditure, because you are living by habit rather than continuously confronting new situations.
Living your life in a predictable way can help reduce relapses, because routine is less stressful than novelty and because it increases your chances for living within your limits.
Your ability to do this depends on your developing a detailed understanding of your limits and then creating a schedule of activity and rest that honors those limits.
The [Daily Schedule](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/files/daily_schedule.pdf) worksheet gives you a way to translate your understanding of capabilities and limits into a daily routine of activities and rest. Developing a daily routine means doing things in a regular and customary way.
As one person said, "Developing a routine and sticking to it have been helpful because the familiarity reduces the number of surprises and lowers the attention that I have to spend on unexpected happenings."
For more on planning, including a page on daily plans and a page on weekly plans, go here (see: Planning). For a personal story, see the article How I Use Routine to Successfully Manage Fibromyalgia (see: How I Use Routine to Successfully Manage Fibromyalgia).
**Reminders**
A technique that works together with the daily schedule is the use of reminders, such as notes posted in prominent places such as the refrigerator, bathroom mirror or computer. Also, devices of various sorts can give you reminders.
For example, you can use a timer to limit the time spent on the computer or housecleaning. Also you can use a [pedometer](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/pedometers-tool-pacing) to help you keep your activity within limits and a [heart rate monitor](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/pacing-numbers-using-your-heart-rate-to-stay-inside-energy-envelope) to stay within your heart rate limit, as described in two articles on the self-help program website.
**Rules**
Another way to change behavior is to create and use a set of personal rules, which are planned responses to various situations. Living by a set of rules reduces the power of spontaneity to overwhelm good judgment. Rules show you how to substitute new ways of doing things for old habitual behaviors. Over time, the new behavior becomes a habit.
Rules can take several forms. Some people have just a few rules to guide them. For example, one person with fairly severe FM or CFS has three rules for herself: no more than three trips outside the house per week, no driving beyond 12 miles from home, and no phone conversations longer than 20 minutes.
If you are bothered by brain fog, you might consider taping rules in some prominent place, like the refrigerator, the bathroom mirror or your computer.
Other people develop a set of rules covering different situations. For example, they might establish rules for how long to stay on the computer, how long to talk on the phone, how much exercise to do, how far they drive, when they go to bed at night and get up in the morning, when and how long they rest during the day, how long they spend in social situations and so on.
If you develop specific rules, you can simplify your illness management program into asking yourself two questions: What situation am I in right now? What is my rule for this situation?
Personal rules have an if/then structure. For example:
- If I’ve been on the computer for 20 minutes, then it’s time to take a 10-minute break
- If it’s 11 am, then it’s time for my morning rest.
- If it’s 9 pm, then it’s time to start getting ready for bed
- If I feel short-tempered, then it's time to take a rest
Still other people write down their strategies for symptom management and carry them with them on a card or post them on the refrigerator or bathroom mirror.
For managing fatigue, people in our program often mention taking daily rests, getting enough sleep, limiting the number of times they leave the house each week, breaking up tasks into small chunks, and limiting the time spent standing up.
For managing pain, common strategies include pain medications, exercise, adequate sleep, daily rests, massage ,and heat and/or cold.
**Records**
Keeping a health log, which should take no more than a few minutes a day, can help you gain consistency in three ways.
First, records help you get a clearer picture of your limits and reveal connections between what you do and your symptoms. Using records, you can discover how much activity you can do safely in a day and a week, and whether there are delayed effects. Also, a log can show the effects of mental and emotioinal events, as well as physical activity.
Second, a log can help you hold yourself accountable. Reviewing your records is like looking yourself in the mirror. One person said, "Logging brings home to me the reality of my illness."
Third, records can motivate you by showing that staying within limits pays off in lower symptoms. Records of progress provide hope.
Work with a log occurs in three steps:
**Write**: make entries in a log
**Analyze**: review the log to gain insights
**Act**: use your insights to make changes
You make daily entries, which usually takes no more than a few minutes. Periodically, say every few weeks, you review your records to learn about your limits. Then, you use strategies such as those in this and the next page to change how you live (the hard part!).
For more, see the article [Heath Logs: Big Payoff on a Small Investment](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/health-logs-big-payoff-a-small-investment) on the self-help program website. Sample logs are available for download on the [Logs, Forms and Worksheets](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/type/log_forms_worksheets) page on the site.
**Note: Think "Sustainability"**
The key to pacing success is to find the level of activity you can sustain over a period of time without worsening your symptoms and then gradually adjusting your life to live within that limit. You can find your sustainable activity level through experimentation.
Many people are helped by asking themselves the queston "What level of activity can I susgtain for a week without making my symptoms worse?" As one person said, "Just asking that quetion forced me to pull back some from the amount of activity I could do in a single day."
If you can sustain a consistent activity level for a week without intensifying your symptoms, congratulations, you are living within your Energy Envelope!

## submnu-Simplifying-86.html

# Simplifying | Treating CFS & FM

|
Use the four simplification strategies below to reduce cognitive problems.
**Do One Thing at a Time ****(Avoid Multi-Tasking****)**** **
You may experience fog when you try to do more than one thing at a time, such as reading while watching TV or talking on the phone while fixing dinner. The solution: instead of multi-tasking, do only one thing at a time.
To stay on-task, teach family members to wait by saying things like “I’m [fixing dinner, talking on the phone, etc.] right now, but I’ll help you as soon as I’m done.”
**Avoid Over-Stimulation**
** **
If you are sensitive to noise, to light or to sensory input coming from more than one source at the same time, limit sensory input. For example, turn off the TV while talking. Find a quiet place to read or do other tasks that require concentration.
** **
**Use Lists and Other Reminders**
Write out your tasks for the day on a To Do list. Use Post-It notes in prominent places to jog your memory. Use the calendar or the alarm on your watch or computer to keep track of appointments and tell you when to do things (or to set limits and remind you to stop).
Organize your house and possessions so that they give you built-in reminders. For example, keep your medicines where you dress, so you will see them and remember to take them when getting up in the morning and getting ready for bed at night.
** **
**Organize and De-Clutter**** **
If you find your physical environment overwhelming, organize your house and remove clutter. For how-to ideas, see the success story Illness and Housekeeping (see: Illness and Housekeeping).

## submnu-Sleep-Disorders-79.html

# Sleep Disorders | Treating CFS & FM

|
If your sleep doesn’t improve despite better sleep hygiene and the use of medications, consider asking your doctor for a referral to a sleep specialist, who can examine you for sleep disorders. Sleep disorders are very common with CFS and FM, affecting a majority of people with CFS and FM, perhaps as many as 80%. Treating them can have a dramatic effect on symptoms.
Two of the most common disorders are sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome.
**Sleep Apnea**
Sleep apnea, meaning absence of breathing, occurs when a person's airway becomes blocked during sleep and he or she stops breathing. An episode can last from a few seconds to a few minutes.The person then awakens, gasps for air and falls asleep again, usually without being aware of the problem. The cycle can occur many times a night, leaving the person exhausted in the morning.
Apnea is a treatable condition. A common remedy is the use of a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine. The patient wears a mask through which a compressor delivers a continuous stream of air, keeping the airway open and thus allowing uninterrupted sleep. Use of a CPAP machine can eliminate 90% to 100% of a person’s sleep apnea. Other treatments used for sleep apnea include oral or nasal devices and surgery to enlarge the airway.
**Restless Legs Syndrome**
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) involves "twitchy limbs," strong unpleasant sensations in the leg muscles that create an urge to move. The problem is often at its worst at night.
Self-management techniques that may help include reducing consumption of caffeine and other stimulants, establishing a regular sleep pattern, doing exercise that involves the legs, distracting yourself by immersing yourself in activity, using hot or cold baths or showers. Iron deficiency is a major cause of restless legs and should be corrected, as should deficiencies in folate and magnesium.
Several categories of medications may help, including sedatives, drugs affecting dopamine, pain relievers and anticonvulsants. Some of the more commonly used drugs for RLS are the pills Requip and Mirapex, and the patch Neupro. On the other hand, antidepressant medications may trigger RLS. This possibility should be considered if your symptoms began after initiation of mood therapy.
For more on the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea and Restless Legs Syndrome, see chapters 11 and 12 in *The Mystery of Sleep *by Dr. Meir Kryger (Yale University Press, 2017).

## submnu-Stress-Avoidance-93.html

# Stress Avoidance | Treating CFS & FM

|
Stress avoidance, the second category of stress managment strategies, is preventive. It involves using self-observation to identify stressful situations and then taking measures to avoid them. The goal is to minimize stress by avoiding stressful situations.
The main ways people with CFS and FM prevent stress are by avoiding stress triggers, and by using pacing, order, and routine.
**Avoiding Stress Triggers**
There are three types of stress triggers: substances that create allergic reactions, situations that produce sensory overload, and certain people.
You can reduce symptoms by avoiding foods and other substances to which you are allergic or sensitive, minimizing situations that create sensory overload, and limiting contact with anxious, negative or overly-demanding people..
If you are particularly sensitive to light, noise or crowds, or experience sensory overload in other ways, avoiding those situations can help you control symptoms. For example, you may socialize mostly at home or in small groups, limit you time shopping or visit restaurangs only during "off hours." Wearing sunglasses and earplugs also reduces sensory input.,
Also, many people with CFS and FM are selective about their exposure to television and movies, avoiding material that is emotionally arousing or has rapid scene changes.
Some people with CFS or FM experience high levels of stress when they interact with people who are anxious negative or demanding. Responses they have made include talking with the person, limiting contact, getting professional help, and ending the relationship.
One person said, "I have cut people out of my life that only irritate or don't support me. It was a hard thing to do but has made a big difference in how I feel."
**Pacing**
Pacing strategies (see: Pacing Strategies) lessen stress. For example, reducing activity level, scheduling activity based on priorities, having short activity periods, scheduling important tasks for your best time of day, taking scheduled rests, and taking time for meditation or prayer all help control stress.
As one person wrote, "I found I could avoid much stress by knowing my limits. Planning too many activities in one day or scheduling them too close together are big stress triggers, so I try to prevent their activation by liming the number of activities in a day and by giving myself plenty of time between activities."
**Routine**
Another way to reduce stress is through routine. Doing things in familiar ways and living your life according to a schedule reduces stress by lessening decision making and increasing predictability. It takes more energy to respond to a new situation than it does to something familiar, so by reducing the surprises and novelty in life, you reduce your stress.
In the words of one person, "Having a daily schedule of activity, rest, exercise, and socializing at set times gave structure to my life. With routine, I had less pressure and fewer surprises and emotional shocks." Another said, "My life was one big roller coaster [but] now I live by a schedule. Routine may sound boring, but it's a must for me."
**Order**
A final area for stress avoidance is order. Living in a well-organized environment reduces stress in two ways. First, you avoid rhe stress of having to hunt for things. If you always put your keys in your purse, you know where to find them.
Second, an orderly environment reduces the emotional distress and the social isolation that can be triggered by a cluttered house that leads some people to feel embarrassed about having guests.
In her article Illness and Housekeeping (see: Illness and Housekeeping), Nancy Fortner describes a series of small practical steps she took to bring order to her house. She says "I have learned how to keep a clean and orderly house, and it has made a big difference to my life and to how I feel about myself."

## submnu-Stress-Reduction-92.html

# Stress Reduction | Treating CFS & FM

|
You can reduce the effects of stressful situations by changing how you respond to them. This is often a gradual process, in which one set of habitual responses are replaced with new ones.
Here are 12 strategies for reducing stress.
**Relaxation**
Physically relaxing activities counteract both the physical and the emotional aspects of stress. Through relaxation, you can reduce muscle tension and anxiety. (Relaxation is also very helpful for controlling pain.)
Examples of relaxing activities include scheduled rest breaks, prayer and meditation, deep breathing, yoga, imagery, taking a bath, and playing with a pet. Many people with CFS and FM uses a daily stress reduction practice.
For step-by-step instructions on five relaxation techniques, see the article [Stress Reduction: Five Practical Techniques](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/stress-reduction-five-practical-techniques) on the self-help program website. (The five are: watching the breath, the body scan, progressive muscle relaxation, the relaxation response, and guided imagery.)
**Mental Adjustments**
Your thoughts can be a source of stress. For example, you may have outdated expectations. You may think that as a “good mother” or “good wife,” you should keep the house as you did before becoming ill. Adjusting your standards to fit your new limits reduces stress and helps you avoid overdoing.
Another way in which thoughts can increase stress is through “self talk,” the internal dialogue we have with ourselves, especially about negative events. For example, you might respond to a crash by saying "Stupid me, I overdid it again. This is hopeless."
You can learn how to recognize and change habitual negative thoughts to be more realistic and more positive. For instructions, see the article [Changing Self-Talk](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/changing-self-talk).
Replacing overly pessimistic thoughts reduces anxiety, sadness and feelings of helplessness.
**Exercise and Movement**
Exercise (see: Exercise) is a natural stress reducer, since it causes your body to produce endorphins and other soothing body chemicals. A similar effect can be obtained through other forms of movement, such as yoga and Tai Chi. If you are worried, just getting up and moving around can help break the spell.
**Supportive Relationships**
Good relations are a buffer against stress. Feeling connected to people who understand and respect you reduces anxiety and counteracts depression. Beyond that, talking to another person may help you clarify your situation.
You may receive such support from a variety of sources, including family members, friends, other people with CFS and FM, and therapists. Support also includes practical assistance, such as help with shopping, cooking, bill paying or housecleaning. For more, see the Relationships (see: Relationships) section of this site.
**Information**
Educating yourself about CFS and FM can be a great stress reducer, as you replace fears with facts. There are at least five other sources of information besides your doctors: patient organizations, the internet, support groups, books, and self-observation.
We'll begi with the item. You are perhaps the most important source of information about your illness. You live with your condition and know it intimately.
You are probably aware of things that intensify symptoms and also things that help you feel better. We encourage you to keep records, but whether or not you log, you can use your knowledge of "what helps" and "what hurts" to increase your control.
As for other sources of information about CFS and FM, wWe suggest you consider the following four guidelines for educating yourself about CFS and/or FM.
1. Use multiple sources: No one person or organization has a monopoly on helpful ideas about CFS and FM. You can counteract the partial perspective of any one source by considering multiple sources.
2. Ask yourself whether the claims you hear about treatments are credible. Some people prey on the desperation of patients, so be skeptical of those who promise recovery.
3. Be willing to experiment, but ask what risks are associated with a treatment and whether the likely gains are consistent with the cost.
4. View education as an ongoing task, but put limits on your inquiry. New development occur from time to time, but breakthroughs are rare.
**Pleasurable Activities**
Enjoyable activities lessen frustration while distracting you from your symptoms. Examples include reading, exercise, watching TV, journaling, listening to music, playing games, doing art projects, pursuing a hobby, and talking to a supportive person.
**Journaling**
Writing may be useful as a stress reducer. You might find it helpful to write out what’s bothering you as a way of venting frustration and lessening worry. Another use of journaling is to help you change perspective on your life. For ideas on how writing can improve your health, see the article [Writing Is Good Medicine](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/writing-is-good-medicine).
Some people have told us they found it very helpful to keep a journal in which they note positive events every day. Over time, they found that their mental attitude toward their illness and their life changed in a positive direction.
For more, see the one person's story in the article [The Healing Power of Gratitude](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/the-healing-power-gratitude) and a review of research on gratitude in the article [Counting Your Blessings: How Gratitude Improves Your Health](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/counting-your-blessings-how-gratitude-improves-your-health).
**Talking and Being Listened To **
It is not surprising that, in a survey, talking to a friend was rated as the number one way to combat worry. Talking to someone you trust provides reassurance and connectedness to dispel worry. Studies have shown that talking to another person changes what is happening in your brain at a physical level.
**Laughter and Humor**
This is another good stress reducer. Watching a funny movie, reading a humorous book, looking at favorite cartoons or laughing with friends can be a great release.
Like exercise, laughter promotes the production of endorphins, brain chemicals that produce good feelings and reduce pain. Research suggests that it can strengthen the immune system, counteract depression and even provide a substitute for aerobic exercise.
**Solitude**** **
For some people, just having time alone can be helpful. One person wrote, “I spend much of my time in quiet, relaxing activities such as reading, needlework, etc. If I have a day that does not allow me to participate in these activities to some minimal extent, I find myself extremely tense, stressed out and emotional.”
**Assertiveness (Taking Control)**
By speaking up for yourself, setting limits and saying “No,” you protect yourself and avoid doing things that intensify symptoms. By having a “voice,” you reduce the stress that results from keeping things inside. For more on assertiveness, including a success story, see the article Assertiveness: A Tool for Reducing Symptoms (see: Assertiveness: A Tool for Reducing Symptoms).
**Medications**
Prescription medications can be helpful as part of a stress management program. As one person said, "I resisted the idea of medications for a long time and now kick myself for having done so. Zoloft has helped me level off my reactions to everyday stress and evened out my mood. Medications are not for everyone, but I've learned to keep my mind open to treating all aspects of my life and not relying on solely one approach."

# Supplements | Treating CFS & FM

|
Supplements are not the heart of treatment, but they may be used to optimize health and may produce modest improvement in some symptoms for some people.
As described elsewhere on this site, the most important treatment of CFS and FM is acceptance of the illness and adaptation to it by means of lifestyle change, which focuses on pacing and includes other adjustments such as stress management.
Dr. Lapp has developed three tests that any vitamin, supplement, or nutraceutical must pass before he recommends it::
- It must be safe
- There has to be a scientific basis for its use
- A majority of individuals who use them must benefit
Based on these criteria, he has found 10 supplements that qualify. They are listed and described in an [article](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/library/dr-lapp's-recommedations-supplements) on the self-help progam website.
Dr. Lapp advises that people try only one new supplement at a time, keeping it if it works and dropping it if it is ineffective. He also suggests stopping the use of a supplement for several weeks once a year to test whether it is still effective. If you experience no change in symptoms during that time, you can save yourself some money by dropping that substance.

# Support Groups &amp; Classes | Treating CFS & FM

|
We strongly recommend that you meet other people who have CFS or FM. Such relationships can provide information about coping strategies, counteract isolation, and offer an opportunity to feel understood, comforted, and inspired.
Support groups, can connect you with others who have CFS or FM, and provide information, such as names of doctors and other professionals who treat people with CFS and fibromyalgia.
Groups also offer a way to be helpful, thus counteracting the loss of self-esteem that often results from serious illness. And, finally, they can offer models of successful coping, thus dispelling fear. Similar experiences are available now on the Internet, in online chat rooms and forums.
While support groups can be helpful, not all provide a positive experience. Some groups are negative in tone, reinforcing a sense of victimhood. Some groups are dominated by one or a few people. Others focus on responding positively to illness and insure participation from all members who wish to speak.
Contact with fellow patients in a group setting can be very powerful and may leave you feeling upset at times. When such contact is negative, it can reinforce isolation and powerlessness.
In a supportive group, however, the discomfort should be followed by a new perspective on your situation and increased confidence about your ability to manage the illness.
We suggest you evaluate support groups based on the effects they have on you. A helpful group is one in which you feel a sense of belonging, which gives you something positive to take home, either inspiration or practical tips, and which offers models of living successfully with illness*.*

# Theoretical Treatments | Treating CFS & FM

|
Several well-known “researchers” have proposed theoretical treatments for the management of CFS and FM. None of these has been shown to be particularly effective in scientific, randomized, placebo-controlled studies. In fact, they may only be helpful in a small subset of persons with CFS/FM. Dr. Lapps’ view is that they should be applied cautiously and only by physicians who are especially knowledgeable in their use.
These theoretical treatments include those associated with the following people: St. Amand, Lerner, Marshall, Pall, Cheney and Von Konynenburg.

# Tips for Caregivers | Treating CFS & FM

|
Caring for someone with CFS or FM can be a stressful experience. You may take on extra responsibilities, experience financial strain, feel frustrated and resentful at times, lose companionship, face uncertainty about the future, and experience both reduced socializing and sexual difficulties.
**Ways to Take Care of Yourself**
Even with all the challenges brought by serious illness, there are many ways to take care of yourself. Here are seven to consider.
**1. Maintain Your Health: **This is the number 1 recommendation of experts on caregiving. To serve your loved one well and to avoid resentment and burnout, take time to get adequate rest, to eat well, and to exercise.
** **
2. Accept Help: When people offer to help, accept the offer and suggest specific things that they can do. If your finances allow, consider paying for help in such areas as meals, housecleaning, and transportation.
** **
3. Take Time for Yourself: Get a respite from caregiving by spending time away from the person who is ill, for example by pursuing a hobby. Give yourself an opportunity for leisure and enjoyment, a way to recharge your batteries.
** **
4. Stay Connected: Avoid isolation and reduce stress by maintaining relationships with extended family and friends. This may mean getting together regularly for exercise or outings with friends, spending time with children or any other kind of socializing that keeps you connected with others. Although it may trigger guilt to be away from the person who is ill, it is essential to have periods of respite.
**5. Consider Counseling**: Be sensitive to signs of stress and consider seeing a counselor if you detect them. Signs that counseling might be appropriate include feeling exhausted, depressed or burned out, or over-reacting, such as by angry outbursts.
Counseling can be helpful for gaining perspective on your situation or to explore communication problems. You might get help in individual sessions or in joint sessions with the person who is ill.
** **
6. Grieve Your Losses: Just as people with CFS and FM experience many losses, so do those around them. They are deprived of part of the companionship the patient used to provide, as well as her work around the house and, in many cases, financial contribution.
And, just as the person who is ill has lost the future she hoped for, so do you have to adjust your dreams for the future.
**7. Create New Shared Activities: **Serious illness may make it impossible for you to spend time with the person who is ill in the same way as before, but you can develop new shared activities to do together.
The goal is to create occasions for shared pleasure, so that the relationship is strengthened and both ill and healthy members of the family don't come to see their relationships as just about illness and deprivation.
**How Not To Be the Bad Guy**
An issue that often comes up in the [family members course](http://www.cfsselfhelp.org/online-courses/family) offered in the self-help program is how to best communicate to the person who is ill that she is about to do something that will intensify her symptoms. In the words of one husband, "I feel like I have to be the bad guy who says 'you should do this' or 'you should not do that'. And that's not always appreciated."
One way to handle this sitution constructively was suggested by a husband who reported that he and his wife had a discussion at time "when she was NOT feeling stressed, tired or overdrawn."
The focus was on what the wife wanted her husband to do and say "when she was moving forward with something I suspected was overdrawing her energy or heading her toward a crash." The wife gave her permission for her husband to remind her twice if he thought she was in danger of overdoing.
He provided an example. The couple asked a friend if she wanted to go to dinner for her birthday. The friend said yes and "my wife said, 'and do you want it to be just us or should we arrange a group to celebrate'.
At that point, I stepped in and said that I thought it should be just the three of us, because of what had happened the last time she arranged an outing for a friend. Coordinating a half dozen people with meal, tickets, and arriving on time was way too much. My life said, 'Oh, right!' and thanked me later."
"The key is asking the person with CFS what they want you to do and getting permission at a time when the person is in a really good, clear state. At least that has worked for us."

## submnu-Weekly-Plans-106.html

# Weekly Plans | Treating CFS & FM

|
When you feel comfortable planning one day at a time, try moving on to planning longer periods, such as a week. The challenge here is to estimate what level of activity you can sustain over a period of time without worsening your symptoms.
Consistency in activity level brings control. You can find your sustainable activity level through experimentation. Maybe you can be active for two hours a day, four hours or fourteen. The way to determine your limit is by trying different amounts of activity and noting the results in a health log.
The person featured in the success story for this page reports that her use of pacing resulted in an increase in her activity level of about 50% over a two year period. She attributes the improvement to a combination of factors that include making detailed daily and weekly schedules, being consistent in her use of the schedules, having several daily rest periods, and keeping records.
Keeping written records is a good aid to realistic planning. A health diary, which shouldn't take more than a few minutes a day to complete, can reveal the connections between what you do and your symptoms. It also helps you hold yourself accountable, by showing you the effects of your decisions. And it can motivate you by showing you that staying inside your limits pays off in lower symptoms and a more stable life.
For more on record keeping, see the [logging](http://www.treatcfsfm.org/content-Logging.html) page on this site and the chapter on [logs and worksheets](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/library/30-logs-worksheets-and-rules) in the text for the self-help program’s introductory course. The latter includes sample health logs.
For more on creating weekly plans, including an example, see the [planning](http://www.cfidsselfhelp.org/library/10-pacing-lifestyle) chapter in the self-help program text.
