			  <p><i>Editor's Note: This article is reprinted, with permission, from  the Winter 2002 issue of ME Essential, the magazine of the ME  Association of England. We post it because of the strong parallels  between the author's approach and the one we advocate: creating stability by  first finding the limits imposed by illness, then living consistently  within them by pacing (balancing activity and rest). <br />
<br />
</i></p>
<p>In the winter of 1996, I was just beginning the final year of a PhD  when I became ill with what felt like an extreme flu without a  head-cold. A visit to my GP resulted in my being given some painkillers,  told I had a virus and being sent to bed for a few days. <br />
<br />
Sure enough  the virus passed and I felt fine again, but within a couple of weeks the  symptoms had returned - albeit mildly. I went back to the doctor who  prescribed the same again with the same results except that when the  virus returned again it was more intense.</p>
<p><br />
After several months of this, I asked to be referred somewhere (not  knowing what was wrong with me). This resulted in a battery of blood  tests being undertaken and, as they all turned up negative (for anaemia,  diabetes and so on). I was referred to the local hospital around 11  months after I first became ill.</p>
<p><br />
Further blood tests were carried out there and I was told that, under a  diagnosis by exclusion, I had Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or Post-Viral  Fatigue Syndrome, commonly known [in England] as ME. I was told that  there was no known cure except for time and adequate rest. <br />
<br />
They did give  me some tricyclic antidepressants for problems I was having sleeping  but, as these affected me 24 hours a day, I soon stopped taking them. I  unsuccessfully tried several other things though: light-box therapy, St.  John's Wort, keeping a food diary and Evening Primrose Oil.</p>
<p><br />
After several months, I progressed through hospital to the Psychiatry  department where I was introduced to Cognitive Behavioural Therapy  (CBT). I was the first person from the Cambridge ME group to get to this  point, although many members had been referred to the local hospital  and ended up in many different places or nowhere at all. <br />
<br />
I put this down  to several things: first, the hospital had no standard procedure for ME  sufferers; second, persistently asking to be made better; third, luck.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy<br />
</b></span></span><br />
CBT is a combination of two therapies: Cognitive Therapy and Behavioural  Therapy. The former seems to be a kind of limited psychiatry concerned  mostly with positive thinking, and the latter modifies the behaviour of  the patient. <br />
<br />
CBT can be, and has been, used for many illnesses, for  example depression, and cancer and is not a cure for either them or ME,  but instead an illness/lifestyle management regime.</p>
<p><br />
For chronic fatigue, this consists essentially of a way to manage, and  over time increase, daily exertion. ME sufferers tend to cycle through  good and bad days in which, respectively, they do as much as possible  while the &quot;feeling good&quot; persists or very little as the &quot;feeling bad&quot;  takes hold. <br />
<br />
Perversely, each of these contributes to the cause of the  other: doing too much on a good day almost always leads to a consequent  bad day and the rest on those bad days often results in feeling better  on subsequent days.</p>
<p><br />
CBT provides a way to flatten out these ups and downs, to replace the  curves with a straight line. The way that it does this is provide a  daily exertion total which the sufferer should not exceed on good days  and should try to reach on bad days (the behavioural element) and to  banish negative thoughts like &quot;why me?&quot;, &quot;I'm never going to get well&quot;  and so on (the cognitive element).</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>My Experience of CBT<br />
</b></span></span><br />
To arrive at an initial daily target, I kept a diary of all exertion,  both mental and physical since both can cause great fatigue, dividing it  into two classes: Heavy (H) and Light (L) along with Rest (R). <br />
<br />
Heavy  included trying to think about my thesis, walking and so on, Light might  be low-level conversation, about the weather, say, and Rest could  include watching something trivial on the telly, or lying in a darkened  room listening to a relaxation tape. <br />
<br />
After the three weeks were up, I  worked out the average amount of H, L and R that I had been managing and  this became my daily target.</p>
<p><br />
Within each day, I tried to spread out the exertion so that periods of  rest were sandwiched between periods of effort. How long these periods  were depended on the task to be done and how I felt. If I spent an hour  going round Tescos (H), I might rest for an hour first, but to write a  few letters each taking 15 minutes (L), a five minute rest between each  could be sufficient.</p>
<p><br />
There is no need to plan the day in advance, although I did find that  trying to keep to a similar routine every day helped me to rest often  enough while I was trying to work on my thesis, e.g. doing periods of  half an hour work and half an hour rest for two hours in the morning and  afternoons. You do need to keep a diary, however, to keep track of how  much energy you have left for the day.</p>
<p><br />
By managing my rest, I could have energy for more things. In the morning  before going to the hospital I spent time reading in bed and, when I  got back, I spent a lot of time resting before going out in the evening.  <br />
<br />
CBT allows you to &quot;save&quot; your energy in this way, over the course of a  day, so that, for instance, you could do nothing all day in order to go  out in the evening. I found that doing this occasionally was fine but  still made me feel worse on following days.</p>
<p><br />
After two or three weeks of doing the CBT, if the daily targets are  being met consistently, then they can be increased. If they are being  missed by a long way, then they can be reduced, or stay the same until  such time as they are being met consistently. The increments might only  be five extra minutes a day.</p>
<p><br />
When I did increase, it felt like real progress. The therapy was  initially conducted under guidance from the hospital but, once grasped,  the idea is that the patient administers it to themselves. This is even  true, to some extent, of the cognitive side of CBT but, as I said  earlier, I never had any problems with motivation or negative thoughts  and so can't really comment on that.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>Pros and Cons of CBT<br />
</b></span></span><br />
The advantages include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>there are no drugs <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>it is easy to do and you can manage it yourself <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>it is flexible <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>it allows you to see where your time really goes <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>you have numbers (the hours of H and L that you achieve) which give you some objective measure of your progress <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>you actually do more - if you have a target of four hours of H  and have already done 3.55, then you are inclined to find something to  do to fill the five minutes whereas previously you would have just  stayed lying on the settee <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>you learn to break tasks down into manageable chunks (such as  first making a note whenever an idea popped into my head for a few days,  then sitting down to write a brief set of notes for the talk I gave  over a couple of evenings, then spending several days writing and typing  this report) <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>a lot of the guilt that goes with having to leave jobs undone is  removed. When I was ill and not doing CBT, I would find that towards  the end of the day when I was really tired, I would start to feel guilty  about not doing enough work on my thesis. Now, when I've done what I  can, or what I'm allowed, then I don't feel guilt because the CBT says  that I shouldn't do any more work.</li>
</ul>
<p>The one disadvantage of CBT is that it requires determination and  some discipline to keep a daily diary and stick to the exertion targets.  Make no mistake, it can be difficult on some days. <br />
<br />
The advantages,  though, will become apparent when you start to find that you have a more  consistent level of energy, that because you didn't go mad and swim 50  laps of the local swimming pool the other day, you've managed to get  that letter to Granny finished and now have 15 minutes to spend on  yourself.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>Conclusions<br />
</b></span></span><br />
When I started CBT, I was doing around three hours of H, four hours of L  and eight hours of R. This may sound a lot but is nothing compared to a  person who does a 9-5 job but, when you start to keep a diary and see  how much energy you actually fritter away yourself, seems quite  reasonable.</p>
<p><br />
After doing it for just over 12 months, I am now well enough to be  working part-time, have nearly finished my thesis, have been discharged  from the hospital and no longer keep a daily diary, just an occasional  one. I am not cured or recovered.</p>
<p><br />
I am still tired all the time, still cannot think deeply without a great  amount of effort, still in pain and still lose concentration - but I  feel very much like I'm heading in the right direction and that this is  due in no small part to the environment created by doing CBT.</p>
<p><br />
CBT is not, nor does it claim to be, a cure but it gives an improvement  in quality of life, a crutch to lean on and, above all, gives you back  some time (five minutes a day is 30 minutes a week, two hours a  month...). In the absence of a cure, I'll settle for that.</p>
<p><br />
<i>Magazine Editor's Note: James is now almost fully recovered and is  working full-time once again. He doesn't know to what extent the CBT was  responsible for his recovery but it seems to have been a positive  experience. In his own words &quot;I still get tired but ME doesn't rule my  life.&quot;</i></p>
