# Webmix

A tool to convert websites to LLM-friendly markdown.

## Description

Webmix crawls a website, extracts content using "Reader Mode" logic (via Trafilatura), and aggregates it into a single Markdown file. This file is optimized for use as context for Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Features

- **Discovery**: Finds pages and generates a Table of Contents.
- **Content Extraction**: Converts HTML to clean Markdown.
- **Link Rewriting**: Converts internal links to explicit textual references.
- **Aggregation**: Combines everything into one file with a `repomix`-like structure.
