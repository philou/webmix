<p><br />
Rebelling against the need to be disciplined is one of the biggest  challenges I've had to overcome in dealing with CFS. I used to hate  living a regulated life, so I ignored my body's limits, and suffered  intense symptoms and frequent crashes. I turned things around when I  accepted that discipline was the only way to treat my illness  successfully. <br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>Giving in to Gain Control</b></span></span></p>
<p><br />
I knew having CFS meant I needed to live my life more carefully, but  sometimes I got fed up with the whole idea of managing my illness. It  felt like a burden. It felt like too much hard work. &quot;Why should I have  to live my life so carefully?&quot; I asked myself. &quot;Healthy people don't.&quot; <br />
<br />
I  was frustrated by the need to adapt to my illness. Even though pacing  and managing my CFS made me feel better, I felt like I was being forced  into it. I rebelled against the idea of being told what to do, even if I  was the one doing the telling.</p>
<p><br />
I think my defiance stemmed from not accepting I was sick and not  acknowledging my life would have to change because of it. Eventually, I  realized fighting my illness was only making things worse. The illness  was not some outside invader trying to take me over, but my own body  begging for rest and a stress-free life, begging for some time to heal  itself. <br />
<br />
I realized that surrendering to the illness was the only way I could  improve my health. There was not some magic pill that was going to cure  me. If I wanted to be well, I had to accept my body's demands, no matter  how severe these seemed to be.</p>
<p><br />
With this realization, I finally became comfortable with the changes I  was making in my life, and I was able to manage my illness effectively  for the first time. And as I began to see results from living within my  energy envelope, I felt motivated to continue. <br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>Using a Flexible Schedule</b></span></span></p>
<p><br />
The transformation into a more disciplined person has been gradual and  often difficult. I'm not naturally an organized person and I have  trouble keeping to a routine. For me, the key to success is flexibility.  I use a special, flexible kind of schedule. Every morning I write a To  Do list, but I choose what tasks I'll do and in what order I'll do them.  <br />
<br />
I also use a chart to map the time I spend resting - two hours each in  the morning, afternoon and evening. I can have this rest whenever I want  to, in short rests or longer ones. In this way, I'm keeping within my  limits, but adapting my life to circumstances and desire.</p>
<p><br />
By keeping to a routine, I can feel better and do more. I free myself  from the control of the illness. Whenever I feel frustrated at having to  live within strict limits, I ask myself, &quot;Do I want to run my life, or  do I want to let the illness do it?&quot; Or I ask, &quot;Is it better to live in  chaos and feel terrible all the time, or keep to a schedule and feel  better? Is exceeding my limits worth the pain?&quot; <br />
<br />
It's all about changing  how I think about doing things that are good for my health. I now see  them not as a duty, but as a choice. I am choosing to do everything I  can do to feel better.</p>
<p><br />
Since I changed my attitude, I don't see routine as a frustration  anymore. I look on it as a way to set myself free from crippling  symptoms and an uncertain existence. I see myself as a full-time carer.  It is my job to manage this illness and look after a sick person (me!). <br />
<br />
How well I do it will determine how good I feel and how much I can  accomplish. I look on the illness itself as a teacher, who is teaching  me to listen to and love my body, and to slow down and enjoy life.</p>
<p><br />
I still have days when I can't make myself live within my energy  envelope no matter what I do, but I use reframing to help me move on.  Instead of beating myself up about it, I just think, &quot;That was today,  tomorrow will be better.&quot; <br />
<br />
I see my routine as a way to love and nurture  my body. I praise myself for everything I do to improve my health, and I  see managing my illness successfully as my greatest achievement. <br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>Small Steps and Rewards </b></span></span></p>
<p><br />
I use many techniques to manage my illness. (I have described some of them in the article <a href="detail-71-How-I-Use-Pacing-to-Manage-CFS.html">How I Use Pacing To Manage CFS</a>.)  Some people have told me they felt tired and discouraged when they read  the long list of strategies I use. All I can say is that I didn't start  doing them all at once! <br />
<br />
The transformation into a more disciplined person was a long-term  process. I introduced these changes gradually, maybe one a week at best,  and I made sure I found the right one before adding the next. I go one  step at a time, and I experiment until I find a strategy that works for  me.</p>
<p><br />
For example, I spent many months trying to find the &lsquo;right' way to  improve my sleep. I tried keeping sleep diaries, setting targets to go  to bed at a certain time, using sleep medications, waking myself up  early - nothing worked, or it only worked for a short time.</p>
<p><br />
What has ended up working best is keeping a &lsquo;sleep hygiene scorecard'  where I give myself points for various actions: going to bed early,  journaling before bed, turning off the TV and computer at a certain  time, and so on. When I reach 100 points, I give myself a reward. <br />
<br />
It  might sound silly, but it really helps! It's such a fun way of improving  my sleep, and if I feel like having the occasional late night I can,  but the incentive is there to have a good sleep routine.</p>
<p><br />
I adapt my routine to suit me. I make resting fun, with talking books,  good music, or relaxation tapes (as well as resting quietly sometimes). I  reward myself and give myself praise by keeping a journal each day of  all the positive things I've done for my health. (I've found praise is a  much better teacher than punishment.) <br />
<br />
I keep my routine flexible and adapt when needed. If something isn't  working or I'm finding it frustrating, I get creative and find a  different way of doing it. And I have to say I enjoy it! When you're  suffering so much uncertainty in your body and your life, having a  routine can be a great comfort, and a way to feel like you're moving  forward with your health. <br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>The Bottom Line: From Control to Acceptance</b></span></span></p>
<p><br />
I rarely overdo it now, and when I do, it's a reminder of how terrible I  used to feel all the time. I find it hard to believe I was once so  edgy, exhausted and in so much pain; always living on the edge of a  crash. Of course, I still suffer pain, fatigue and many other symptoms,  but they don't dominate my life to the extent they once did.</p>
<p><br />
My experience with CFS has helped me to understand what I can control  and what I can't. After living with CFS since 1995, I've concluded that I  can't ultimately control the course of my illness. I think a fellow  patient put it best when she said, &quot;All I can do is give my body the  best possible opportunity to heal itself, and then the results are out  of my hands.&quot;</p>
<p><br />
That's what pacing and looking after myself is all about - giving my  body the best possible opportunity to heal itself. For me, having a  sense of &lsquo;control' is about knowing I can affect the course of my  illness through my actions. I have the power to make myself feel better  or worse. How I treat my body might not determine whether I recover, but  it will determine how well I feel.</p>
<p><br />
Releasing the idea I could get rid of this illness and focusing my  energies on what I could do to feel better now was a powerful and  life-changing experience. I had to let go of the idea that I could  control my own body, and let it lead me instead. <br />
<br />
I had to employ all of  my creativity and determination to change the way I did things. In this  way, I found freedom from CFS and the strength to live a disciplined  life.</p>			  </td>
