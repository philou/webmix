			  <p><i>Note: Bianca Veness, a CFS patient from Australia, is a moderator  in the CFIDS &amp; Fibromyalgia Self-Help program. This article is  adapted from a message sent to a class she taught. <br />
</i></p>
<p><br />
I spent many years fighting my illness and the limits it imposed on me,  and experienced frequent crashes as a result. Eventually I recognized  the futility of my approach and adopted a new attitude to my CFS. <br />
<br />
Rather  than fighting my illness, I accepted it and, over time, have created a  new way of life in tune with my body. By learning from the illness, I've  moved from a roller coaster life to a life with more peace and  stability, and a lower level of symptoms.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>Fighting My Limits<br />
</b></span></span><br />
I was diagnosed with CFS when I became bedbound with the illness. After  spending a year at home recuperating, I went on to finish high school  then moved away from home to go to college. <br />
<br />
During this time I often  didn't tell people I was sick, and when I did they had trouble believing  it, because I worked harder than anyone else. I held myself to  impossibly high standards, wanting to prove the illness couldn't stop me  from leading a normal life.</p>
<p><br />
I fought my limits all the time. I would crash, be forced to spend weeks  or months recovering, then do it all over again. I experienced peaks  and troughs in my health, but the general trend of my health was  downward. Eventually I didn't feel I could manage any more and I dropped  out of school.</p>
<p><br />
Leaving school helped me to realize that I was living the wrong kind of  life. I was trying to force myself beyond my limits, always pushing the  envelope, battling against my illness. It was painful. I had high  symptoms, frequent severe crashes and was constantly in a state of  stress, anxiety and emotional turmoil. I blamed the illness for doing  this to me.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>Illness as Teacher<br />
</b></span></span><br />
Gradually I came to realize that the illness was not responsible for my  stressful life; I was. I was not acknowledging that my body had changed  and had different needs now. <br />
<br />
Rather than seeing the illness as an enemy,  I began to see it as a teacher, one that was trying to teach me a  valuable lesson - to slow down! Instead of trying to fight the illness, I  accepted it. I gave up the idea of returning to my pre-illness life,  and began to develop a new way of living.</p>
<p><br />
This might sound like I was giving up hope, but actually it was an  incredibly hope-creating experience. I finally acknowledged that I was  unwell, that I would have to live a different kind of life, maybe for  the rest of my life. And that was okay. Rather than seeing the illness  as a prison, and the need to stay within my energy envelope as a trap, I  began to see my situation in terms of freedom.</p>
<p><br />
I was freeing myself from a life of unpredictability, from feeling  constantly overwhelmed and exhausted. By changing the way I saw my  illness and my life, I freed myself from having to live up to the  impossible expectations I had for myself. It was a wonderful feeling.  Now, I could just be.</p>
<p><br />
I began to really listen to my body and to look after myself, using many  of the skills we learn in the CFIDS &amp; FM self-help class like  pacing, resting, relaxation and planning. I began to meditate, developed  new, less tiring interests, and worked on becoming a more centered  person.</p>
<p><br />
And what I became was happy! Not all the time, obviously, but I'm a much  happier person now. A lot of my secondary symptoms have evaporated, and  I can manage the other ones reasonably well. Because I work with my  body rather than against it, I'm not crashing all the time, which means I  can do a lot more than others in my state of health.</p>
<p><br />
Someone in one of my classes made a really good point when she said,  &quot;I've got to strike a balance somehow, and live a lifestyle that I can  manage even when I'm feeling the worst.&quot; Finding that point of balance  was really important for me. I don't live a perfect life now; I still  overdo it sometimes. But I am not always overdoing it, always pushing my  limits and then reaching crisis point.</p>
<p><br />
I'm in a place where if I overdo it once, I can recover. I haven't had a  major crash in over two years, only a few minor flares, even though  I've had my share of troubles during that time (including three moves  and nursing a sick family member back to health after a car accident).</p>
<p><br />
CFS has been a wise teacher, giving me the same lesson again and again  until I learned it. It has taught me to acknowledge my body's needs, and  to spend my energy wisely, doing things I enjoy. It has taught me to be  organized and to put thought into what I do. It has taught me to value  the important things in life, and to let go of the little things. It has  taught me to accept myself as I am.</p>
<p><br />
Some of these lessons have been very painful, and some I am still  learning, but the process has been worthwhile. It has enabled me to grow  as a person in ways I wouldn't have otherwise. <br />
<br />
I've learned patience,  discipline and serenity, and all the time spent on my own has given me a  chance to become a more spiritual person. CFS paradoxically has been a  healing experience for me, as my journey through the illness has led me  toward wholeness as a person.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="font-family: Georgia"><b>From Hare to Tortoise<br />
</b></span></span><br />
My experience with CFS reminds me of the story of the hare and the  tortoise. Like me in my early years with the illness, the hare goes full  tilt towards the finish line, collapses exhausted half-way through and  never gets to finish the race! The tortoise, on the other hand, knows  how much he can handle. He goes slow and steady and never exceeds his  limits, but gets there in the end.</p>
<p><br />
Over time, I've realized that for me 'giving all I have' is not about  giving all I have towards doing some task that I feel I 'must' do. It's  about giving myself up to the path on which I've been placed (by a  higher power, by life or just by circumstance) and accepting it.  Allowing myself to be ill, and moving forward, like a tortoise, working  with the illness to create a better kind of life.</p>
<p><br />
I deeply respect everyone with CFS/FM. It is a hard illness to manage. I  am filled with awe and admiration for my fellow patients, who struggle  along against sometimes incredible odds. I see a lot of courage,  fortitude and patience.</p>
<p><br />
The value of a tortoise is not about success, money, being the best. The  value of a tortoise is in accepting who you are and where you're at; in  taking life slowly, and enjoying it along the way. Living the best life  you can with what you've been given, which is more courageous and more  heroic than anything else I can think of.</p>			  </td>
